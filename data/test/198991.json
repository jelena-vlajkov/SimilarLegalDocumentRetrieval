We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\n\nremand.\n\n                                       I\n\n            Our review of the record is in a light most favorable to\nthe party opposing summary judgment.              Dávila-Pérez v. Lockheed\n\nMartin Corp., 202 F.3d 464, 466 (1st Cir. 2000).\n            Centennial, a subsidiary of New Jersey-based Centennial\nCellular Corp. (parent company), is a telecommunications business\n\nthat began operations in Puerto Rico in early 1996. Amaury Rivera,\nCentennial's vice president and general manager, and Thomas Bucks,\nchief financial officer and comptroller of the parent company,\ninterviewed Santiago-Ramos for a position as Centennial's director\n\nof finance and administration.               Rivera gave Santiago-Ramos a\n\nwritten job offer dated June 12, 1996, which she accepted and\n\nreturned as requested.         Santiago-Ramos was chosen over two male\n\napplicants and received several work assignments before formally\n\nbeginning   work   on   July    1,   1996.     She   also   signed   a   90-day\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fprobationary contract dated July 1, but she disputes that the\n\nprobationary contract is valid.\n\n            Santiago-Ramos was the only female among Centennial's\nfour high-level executives.        She was responsible for Centennial's\n\nfinance,     certain     personnel       matters       (including      oversight\n\nresponsibility for the drafting and implementation of an employee\nmanual), and some inventory assignments.               Because Centennial was\n\nbeginning     operations      in      Puerto       Rico,      all     employees'\n\nresponsibilities were somewhat fluid and all were expected to work\n\nmore than the normal 40-hour work week.              Santiago-Ramos reported\n\ndirectly to Rivera in Puerto Rico and to Bucks at the parent\n\ncompany. Phil Mayberry, the parent company's senior vice president\n\nfor Puerto Rico operations, was Rivera's direct supervisor and\noversaw all Puerto Rico operations from his parent company office.\n\n            At the time she worked for Centennial, Santiago-Ramos had\n\none child and planned to have another child within several years.\nAfter beginning work, she was directly asked about her ability to\n\nbalance work and family obligations. In one instance, Rivera asked\n\nSantiago-Ramos      whether   it   was      possible    for    her    to   handle\n\nsimultaneously her job, child care, and marital responsibilities.\n\nSeveral    times,   he   questioned      how   her   husband    was    managing,\n\nconsidering she was not home to cook for him.              The questions were\n\nnot asked only by Rivera:          two weeks before she was dismissed,\n\nMayberry asked Santiago-Ramos how well her work was proceeding in\n\nlight of her child.      She responded that her work was going well and\n\nthat she planned to have a second child within several years.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fMayberry stated that having another child was a lot of work, and he\n\nquestioned whether Santiago-Ramos could perform her job effectively\n\nafter having a second child.          She responded that she would be able\nto meet both work and family obligations.             Santiago-Ramos sensed\n\nthat Mayberry disliked her response.\n\n          Another   incident          directly   involved     Santiago-Ramos,\nRivera, and Mayberry. During Santiago-Ramos' tenure at Centennial,\n\nthe company planned a major job fair at which a large number of\n\nemployees would be hired. In preparation for the event, Rivera met\n\nwith   Santiago-Ramos     and    an    advertising    consultant.       Rivera\n\ndiscussed a profile he drafted identifying the people the company\n\nwas and was not interested in hiring.               The profile purportedly\n\nexcluded from consideration as Centennial employees older persons\nwith heavy non-work commitments, married women, and women with\n\nchildren. Rivera told Santiago-Ramos that the profile was \"nothing\n\npersonal against you,\" but that he preferred unmarried, childless\nwomen because they would give 150% to the job.                   Later in this\n\nmeeting, Rivera telephoned Mayberry, read the profile to him, and\n\nMayberry approved it.     Santiago-Ramos told Rivera that she opposed\n\nthe profile, stating it was discriminatory.                However, she never\n\nreported her objection to Mayberry or any other parent company\n\nrepresentative.     She    did    not    actually    see   the   profile,   and\n\nquestions regarding marriage and children were not included on the\n\ninterview questionnaire used at the job fair.\n\n           Nor were these the only comments made by Rivera and\n\nMayberry concerning women employees and pregnancy.               For instance,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fRivera   allowed   Santiago-Ramos       to    choose   his   new    secretary.\n\nSantiago-Ramos hired Toni Mejías, a mother of two.                 When Rivera\n\nlater discovered that Mejías had two children, he questioned\nSantiago-Ramos about whether her choice was a good one. On another\n\noccasion, Mayberry and a number of employees from the parent\n\ncompany visited Puerto Rico to assist in the Centennial job fair.\nUpon noticing that Santiago-Ramos was speaking with another female\n\nemployee, Mayberry called out to nearby male employees, \"guys watch\n\nout with the females, next thing we know they will be running the\n\ncompany.\"    Also, Mejías heard Mayberry state that he did not like\n\nwomen with children working at Centennial.             Other evidence puts\n\nMayberry's     comments    in   perspective:       Bucks     testified   in   a\n\ndeposition that it did not surprise him that Mayberry questioned\nwhether women with children could fulfill work responsibilities,\n\nand Rivera referred to Mayberry as a \"big time machista.\"\n\n            Mayberry and Rivera were not the only Centennial and\nparent company employees who made comments about women, work, and\n\nchildren. We relate several instances by way of illustration. Two\n\nemployees in Santiago-Ramos' department stated that a secretary at\n\nCentennial who was on maternity leave should not have become\n\npregnant so soon after joining the company and that she would most\n\nlikely be fired as a result.        These same employees told Santiago-\n\nRamos and Mejías separately that they should not get pregnant or\n\nthey would be fired.       On a trip Santiago-Ramos took for training at\n\nthe   parent    company,    one   of    the   parent   company's     directors\n\ncomplained to Santiago-Ramos that his secretary stopped working\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\flate after having children, and \"that is what happens when we hire\n\nfemales in the child-bearing years.\"             A parent company employee,\n\nwho came to Puerto Rico to assist with the job fair, told Santiago-\nRamos that he was \"in the interviewing mood,\" and asked her in\n\nfront of a number of other employees how long she had been married,\n\nhow many children she had, and what their ages were.\n          During       her   three   months'     employment    at   Centennial,\n\nseveral problems occurred that Centennial, at least partially,\n\nattributes to her.           First, when a shipment of 500 telephones\n\ncrucial to Centennial's telecommunications operations arrived, five\n\ntelephones,     with    a    combined    value   of   $2000,   were    missing.\n\nSantiago-Ramos had inventory responsibility over this shipment, and\n\nthat these units were missing was not discovered until several days\nafter   the    telephones      arrived.       Second,   Centennial     incurred\n\ndemurrage charges on a shipment containing communications towers\n\nbecause they were picked up at the San Juan docks late.                However,\nSantiago-Ramos denies that she was responsible for ensuring that\n\nthe towers were properly received.            Third, electrical service was\n\ncut off at several Centennial locations because utility bills were\n\nunpaid.   Santiago-Ramos was responsible to pay these bills, and\n\nCentennial bore reconnect charges to restore power.                 Fourth, the\n\nCentennial employee manual, over which Santiago-Ramos had ultimate\n\noversight responsibility, was not completed during her employment.\n\n              Because Centennial was a start-up company, its employees\n\nwere under constant evaluation.           Nevertheless, neither Bucks nor\n\nRivera ever told Santiago-Ramos that her work was unsatisfactory.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fWhen Santiago-Ramos came to the parent company for training two\n\nweeks   before   her   dismissal,      Mayberry     stated   that   he    had    no\n\nintention of firing her.            Rivera reported that up to the day\nMayberry instructed him to do so, he also had no intention of\n\nfiring her.\n\n           On    September    27,    1996,    Santiago-Ramos'    89th     day    of\nemployment with Centennial, Mayberry told Rivera to dismiss her.\n\nRivera did so without providing Santiago-Ramos an explanation. The\n\nevents leading up to that decision are not entirely clear.                      For\n\ninstance, Bucks testified in his deposition that he, Rivera, and\n\nMayberry jointly discussed Santiago-Ramos' employment during the\n\npreceding week and collectively agreed that her employment should\n\nbe terminated.    Mayberry stated that he discussed firing Santiago-\nRamos and his rationale for doing so several times with Rivera.\n\nHowever,   Rivera   recalls    only    one    conversation,     held     the    day\n\nMayberry told him to fire Santiago-Ramos.              The record contains a\nmemorandum Rivera wrote dated September 27, 1996, stating that\n\nSantiago-Ramos was dismissed and identifying four reasons for doing\n\nso;   however,   Mejías,     who    typed    the   memorandum   from     Rivera's\n\ndictation, testified in a deposition that the memorandum was not\n\nprepared on September 27, and was only written after Santiago-Ramos\n\ninitiated legal proceedings against Centennial.                  It is clear,\n\nhowever, that Santiago-Ramos' responsibilities were assumed by\n\nother employees.\n\n           Santiago-Ramos filed this action and, after extensive\n\ndiscovery, Centennial moved for summary judgment.               Santiago-Ramos\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fmoved for partial summary judgment on several of her Puerto Rico\n\nlaw claims.    The magistrate judge granted Centennial's motion for\n\nsummary judgment, denied Santiago-Ramos' motion for partial summary\njudgment, refused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\n\nPuerto Rico law claims, and entered judgment for Centennial.\n\n                                  II\n\n            The parties dispute whether the magistrate judge properly\n\napplied the summary judgment standard. \"We review summary judgment\n\nde novo, viewing the entire record in the light most hospitable to\n\nthe party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable\ninferences in that party's favor.\"     Dávila-Pérez, 202 F.3d at 466\n\n(internal quotations and citations omitted).     Summary judgment is\nappropriate only if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material\nfact\" and \"the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter\n\nof law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).     \"A dispute is genuine if the\nevidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could\nresolve the point in the favor of the non-moving party.    A fact is\n\nmaterial if it carries with it the potential to affect the outcome\nof the suit under the applicable law.\"     Sánchez v. Alvarado, 101\n\nF.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotations and citations\n\nomitted).\n            The moving party \"bears the initial responsibility of\ninforming the district court of the basis for its motion, and\n\nidentifying those portions of [the record] which it believes\ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).        \"Once the\n\n                                 -8-\n\fmoving party has properly supported [its] motion for summary\n\njudgment, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party, with respect to\n\neach issue on which [it] has the burden of proof, to demonstrate\nthat a trier of fact reasonably could find in [its] favor.\"\n\nDeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir. 1997), citing\n\nCelotex, 477 U.S. at 322-25.         In opposing summary judgment, the\nnonmoving party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials\n\nof [the] pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that\n\nthere is a genuine issue\" of material fact as to each issue upon\n\nwhich he or she would bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986) (internal\n\nquotations, citation, and alteration omitted).\n\n            We address one other issue before the merits.             Santiago-\nRamos filed a sworn affidavit, in addition to documentary evidence\n\nand transcripts of portions of depositions, in her opposition to\n\nCentennial's motion for summary judgment. Santiago-Ramos cited her\naffidavit frequently in her argument.             Both Centennial and the\n\nmagistrate judge fault her for doing so, stating that the self-\n\nserving statements, produced after her receipt of Centennial's\n\nsummary judgment motion, should be given less credibility than\n\nother evidence in the record.    Centennial cites Wright and Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure §§ 2722, 2738 (1998), for the\n\nproposition that judges should afford less weight to affidavits\n\nthan   to   deposition   testimony    when    deciding      summary    judgment\n\nmotions.      Santiago-Ramos   relies        on   Federal    Rule     of   Civil\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fProcedure    56,     which   states   that       affidavits     may    be     used   in\n\nsupporting and opposing motions for summary judgment.\n\n            The law regarding this dispute is clear.                  To the extent\nthat affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary\n\njudgment    merely    reiterate   allegations         made    in   the   complaint,\n\nwithout providing specific factual information made on the basis of\npersonal knowledge, they are insufficient.                Roslindale Coop. Bank\n\nv. Greenwald, 638 F.2d 258, 261 (1st Cir. 1981), citing Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(e).          However, a \"party's own affidavit, containing\n\nrelevant information of which he has first-hand knowledge, may be\n\nself-serving, but it is nonetheless competent to support or defeat\n\nsummary judgment.\"       Cadle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957, 961 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 1997), citing Nereida-González v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d\n701, 706 (1st Cir. 1993).       Santiago-Ramos' affidavit contains more\n\nthan the allegations made in her complaint:                  it provides specific\n\nfactual information based upon her personal knowledge.                      It may be\nself-serving, but it complies with the requirements of the federal\n\nrules, and we therefore must consider it together with the other\n\nevidence before the magistrate judge.\n\n                                      III\n\n            The first issue is whether the magistrate judge erred in\ngranting summary judgment to Centennial on Santiago-Ramos' sex\ndiscrimination claim.        Title VII makes it \"an unlawful employment\n\npractice for an employer . . . to discharge any individual . . .\nbecause     of   such     individual's       .    .   .   sex.\"          42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1). If the employer's decision is made \"because of or\n\n                                      -10-\n\fon   the   basis   of   pregnancy,     childbirth,    or   related   medical\n\nconditions,\" it is made \"because of sex.\"             Id. § 2000e(k).         A\n\nTitle VII sex discrimination claim may be proven with direct\nevidence of discrimination, such as \"an admission by the employer\n\nthat it explicitly took actual or anticipated pregnancy into\n\naccount in reaching an employment decision.\" Smith v. Morse & Co.,\n\n76 F.3d 413, 421 (1st Cir. 1996).           Such \"smoking gun\" evidence is\n\nrare, but sex discrimination may also be proven with circumstantial\n\nevidence.     Domínguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424,\n\n428-29 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            When   considering       circumstantial    evidence      of     sex\n\ndiscrimination, we apply a three-stage, burden-shifting framework\n\nthat was first articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\nU.S. 792 (1973), and further delineated in Texas Department of\n\nCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), and St. Mary's\n\nHonor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502 (1993).                The analysis \"is\nintended progressively to sharpen the inquiry into the elusive\n\nfactual question of intentional discrimination.\" Burdine, 450 U.S.\n\nat 255 n.8.\n\n                                      1.\n\n            An   employee   alleging    sex    discrimination    must     first\nestablish a prima facie case by showing that:          (1) she belonged to\na protected class, (2) she performed her job satisfactorily,\n\n(3) her employer took an adverse employment decision against her,\nand (4) her employer continued to have her duties performed by a\n\ncomparably qualified person.     Smith, 76 F.3d at 421.         This task \"is\n\n                                     -11-\n\fnot onerous,\"       Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, and can result in a\n\nrebuttable presumption \"that the employer unlawfully discriminated\n\nagainst the employee.\"        Id. at 254.\n             Three elements of Santiago-Ramos' prima facie case are\n\nclearly met:      she is a woman; she was fired; and comparable persons\n\ncontinued to perform her work responsibilities.           Whether Santiago-\nRamos performed her job satisfactorily at Centennial is not as\n\nclear. However, we need not reach this issue because of our second\n\ninquiry.\n\n                                        2.\n\n             At the second stage, the burden shifts to the employer to\n\nstate   a   legitimate,     nondiscriminatory    reason      for   the    adverse\nemployment action.

If the employer meets its\nburden, the presumption of discrimination evaporates.               Id.\n\n             Centennial     advanced    the   following   nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons     for   firing   Santiago-Ramos:       (1)   the    missing     phones\nincident; (2) the communications towers demurrage charges; (3) the\nunpaid electrical bills; (4) failure to complete the employee\n\nmanual; (5) her general attitude and lack of commitment.

See id.     We first address whether evidence of\n\npretext    exists,     having     in   mind      that       courts     should   exercise\nparticular caution before granting summary judgment for employers\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fon such issues as pretext, motive, and intent.            Hodgens v. General\n\nDynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 167 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            Santiago-Ramos can establish that Centennial's stated\nreasons for her dismissal are a pretext for discrimination in a\n\nnumber of ways. One method is to show that discriminatory comments\n\nwere made by the key decisionmaker or those in a position to\ninfluence the decisionmaker.          Mulero-Rodríguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98\n\nF.3d 670, 675-76 (1st Cir. 1996). There is evidence that Mayberry,\n\nhead of Puerto Rico operations for the parent company, was the key\n\ndecisionmaker in the termination of Santiago-Ramos' employment. It\n\nis also clear that Rivera, Santiago-Ramos' direct supervisor and\n\ngeneral manager in Puerto Rico, was in a position to influence\n\nMayberry in that decision.            Mayberry was located at the parent\ncompany and Rivera was based in Puerto Rico.             The two held \"almost\n\ndaily conference calls\" during the crucial start-up phase when\n\nSantiago-Ramos        worked   at   Centennial.     Rivera   testified     that\nMayberry called him for his opinion regarding Santiago-Ramos'\n\ndismissal.       Bucks also testified that Rivera was involved in the\n\ndecision. This evidence is sufficient to support an inference that\n\nRivera     was   in    a   position    to    influence   Mayberry,   the    key\n\ndecisionmaker.\n\n            The record reveals a number of comments made by both\n\nMayberry and Rivera suggesting their concern about Santiago-Ramos\n\npossibly having a second child while working at Centennial, as well\n\nas concern about women with children working at Centennial in\n\ngeneral.     For purposes of summary judgment, we cannot weigh the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fcredibility of witnesses making these comments and must assume they\n\nwere   made    as    stated.        DeNovellis,        124      F.3d   at    308,    quoting\n\nAnderson,     477     U.S.    at    249.         The   magistrate        judge      reviewed\nMayberry's and Rivera's comments and held that they were \"stray\n\nremarks,\"      insufficient         to    enable       a   jury    to       conclude   that\n\nCentennial's reasons for dismissing Santiago-Ramos were pretextual.\nWe do not read the record the same way.\n\n              For    example,       two    weeks        prior     to    Santiago-Ramos'\n\ntermination, she traveled to the parent company for training.                            At\n\nthat time, Mayberry had no intention of firing her, despite knowing\n\nof her work problems.               At a dinner held during the training,\n\nMayberry specifically asked Santiago-Ramos about her ability to\n\nbalance   her       current      work    and   parental      responsibilities.            In\nresponse to Santiago-Ramos' response that she was balancing her\n\nduties well         and   that     she   would    have     another      child,      Mayberry\n\nquestioned       Santiago-Ramos'           ability         to     fulfill        her    work\nresponsibilities should she have a second child.                              The subject\n\nmatter of Mayberry's comments (Santiago-Ramos' ability to work as\n\na mother) coupled with Mayberry's previous impression of Santiago-\n\nRamos (he was not inclined to fire her), together with the timing\n\nof Santiago-Ramos' dismissal (just two weeks after Mayberry made\n\nthe    comments),         provides       circumstantial          evidence      about     the\n\npretextual      nature     of     Centennial's         proffered       nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons for Santiago-Ramos' dismissal.                       Such comments, made by\n\nMayberry (the key decisionmaker), together with similar comments\n\nfrom Rivera (one in a position to influence the decisionmaker),\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\fcould lead a jury to conclude that Centennial's proffered reasons\n\nfor   firing   Santiago-Ramos   were      actually        a    pretext   for\n\ndiscrimination.\n          Santiago-Ramos also points to comments made by others at\n\nCentennial and the parent company that illustrate a discriminatory\n\nattitude in the company as a whole.     Typically, statements made by\n\"one who neither makes nor influences [a] challenged personnel\n\ndecision are not probative in an employment discrimination case.\"\n\nMedina-Muñoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   However, evidence of a company's general atmosphere of\n\ndiscrimination \"may be considered along with any other evidence\n\nbearing on motive in deciding whether a Title VII plaintiff has met\n\nher burden of showing that the defendants' reasons are pretexts.\"\nSweeney v. Board of Trustees of Keene State College, 604 F.2d 106,\n\n113 (1st Cir. 1979) (emphasis added).          As recounted earlier, a\n\nnumber of other persons at Centennial and the parent company made\ncomments to Santiago-Ramos and others concerning the company's\n\ntreatment of female employees with children.        While these comments\nare not proof of discrimination against Santiago-Ramos, they \"add\n\n'color' to the decision-making process at [Centennial] and to the\n\nreasons given for [her dismissal].\"      Id.     A jury could reasonably\n\nrely upon these comments, together with other evidence such as\n\ncomments by the decisionmakers, in concluding that Centennial's\n\nexplanations are pretextual.\n\n          Another method of establishing pretext is to show that\n\nCentennial's   nondiscriminatory       reasons     were       after-the-fact\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fjustifications, provided subsequent to the beginning of legal\n\naction.    See Mariani Giron v. Acevedo Ruiz, 834 F.2d 238, 239 (1st\n\nCir. 1987)    (section   1983   case);    Lex    K.    Larson,   1   Employment\n\nDiscrimination § 8.04 at 8-76 (2d ed. 2000).                     A jury could\n\ninterpret from the timing of such comments that Centennial's\n\nreasons are pretextual.         On September 27, 1996, the date of\nSantiago-Ramos'    dismissal,    Rivera    did    not     tell   her   why   her\n\nemployment was being terminated.     A memorandum dated that same day\n\nidentifies several reasons for the decision.             However, Mejías, who\n\ntyped that memorandum from Rivera's dictation, stated that it was\n\nprepared several weeks subsequent to the termination, after it was\n\nclear that Santiago-Ramos was initiating legal action against\n\nCentennial.    A jury could rely upon Mejías' statement to conclude\nthat Centennial's stated reasons for firing Santiago-Ramos were\n\nmerely pretextual post hoc justifications because they were only\n\nprovided in anticipation of litigation.\n            Santiago-Ramos can also establish pretext by showing\n\n\"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or\n\ncontradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons\" such\n\nthat a factfinder could \"infer that the employer did not act for\n\nthe asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\" Hodgens, 144 F.3d at 168\n\n(internal quotations and citations omitted). A factfinder could do\n\nso here.      First, as the magistrate judge held, the evidence\n\nregarding the demurrage charges Centennial incurred because of the\n\ntardy receipt of the communications towers suggests that this\n\nreason could be considered pretextual.                There is evidence that\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fSantiago-Ramos was never assigned responsibility to pick up the\n\ntowers, that she was unaware that the towers had arrived in Puerto\n\nRico before she was dismissed, and that no one had reprimanded her\nabout the towers incident during her tenure with Centennial.\n\nSecond, Centennial cites the missing telephone incident as an\n\nimportant    reason   for   firing   Santiago-Ramos,   stating   that   the\ntelephones were crucial to its start-up operations.          However, at\n\nthe time the incident occurred, Rivera told Santiago-Ramos that it\n\nwas \"a minor matter.\"       That the incident was minor to Rivera is\n\nsupported by his assertion that he had no intention to fire her\n\nbefore being told to do so.            Third, Centennial now stresses\n\nSantiago-Ramos' failure to complete the employee manual as a reason\n\nfor her dismissal, although that problem did not appear in Rivera's\nmemorandum regarding Santiago-Ramos' dismissal. The record reveals\n\nthat Santiago-Ramos had ultimate oversight responsibility for the\n\ncompletion of the manual and that before Santiago-Ramos' dismissal\nMayberry expressed concern that it was not completed.            However,\n\nthere is also evidence, from both Santiago-Ramos and Lourdes Lucas,\n\nthe parent company's legal counsel, that Centennial's outside legal\n\ncounsel was asked to provide a first draft of the manual and that\n\nrevisions would have to be made to that draft.            Santiago-Ramos\n\ntestified that outside counsel was tardy in providing the first\n\ndraft and that the revision process was underway when she was\n\nfired.      Based upon these weaknesses in the nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons Centennial provided, the jury could find that the reasons\n\nwere pretextual.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f             Having discussed whether Centennial's nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons were pretextual, we now address whether the record contains\n\nsufficient evidence of discriminatory animus.          Domínguez-Cruz, 202\nF.3d at 431.     There is sufficient evidence here.              For instance,\n\nafter Santiago-Ramos told Mayberry that she was planning on having\n\na   second   child   in    the   next    several   years,   he    specifically\nquestioned whether she would be able to manage her work and family\n\nresponsibilities;         shortly   thereafter,      her     employment    was\n\nterminated.\n\n             Having reviewed the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Santiago-Ramos, Domínguez-Cruz, 202 F.3d at 433, we conclude\n\nthat there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury\n\ncould find that Centennial's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons\nfor her dismissal were pretextual and that the actual reason was\n\ndiscriminatory. Our view of the facts at this point is necessarily\n\nshaped by the summary judgment standard of review and is only \"a\ndescription of the permissible inferences that could be drawn from\n\nthe facts and that suffice to defeat summary judgment.\"                    Id.\n\nIndeed, after the full presentation of the evidence at trial, a\n\nfactfinder might very well decide differently.             But Santiago-Ramos\n\nhas raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the actual reason\n\nfor her dismissal, and this suffices to allow her to present her\n\nsex discrimination case at trial.          We reverse the magistrate judge\n\non this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f                                      IV\n\n           The next issue is whether the magistrate judge erred in\n\ngranting   summary    judgment   to        Centennial   on    Santiago-Ramos'\n\nretaliation claim.     Pursuant to Title VII:\n\n             It shall be an unlawful employment\n             practice for an employer to discriminate\n             against any of his employees . . . because\n             he has opposed any practice made an\n             unlawful employment practice by this\n             subchapter, or because he has made a\n             charge,    testified,     assisted,     or\n             participated   in   any   manner   in   an\n             investigation, proceeding, or hearing\n             under this subchapter.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).     A prima facie case of retaliation is made\nby a showing that:       (1) the employee engaged in conduct that\nTitle VII protects; (2) the employee suffered an adverse employment\n\naction; and (3) the adverse action is causally connected to the\nprotected activity.     Hernández-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading,\n\nInc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           Santiago-Ramos argues that she was fired because she\nopposed the job fair profile Rivera presented, which allegedly\nexcluded older persons with commitments, pregnant women, and women\nwith children.       There is evidence that Rivera proposed such a\n\npolicy and that Santiago-Ramos opposed it.          However, there is also\nevidence   that   Santiago-Ramos      never    reported      her   concerns   to\n\nMayberry or anyone else at the parent company.\n           For a retaliation claim \"to survive a motion for summary\njudgment, the plaintiff must point to evidence in the record that\n\nwould permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the employment\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\faction was retaliatory.\"          King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965,\n\n968 (1st Cir. 1997). Even assuming that Santiago-Ramos established\n\nthe first two elements of the retaliation prima facie case, the\nmagistrate judge correctly granted summary judgment on this claim\n\nbecause Santiago-Ramos has not established the third element: that\n\nher dismissal was causally related to her opposition to the job\nfair   profile.      The    only    evidence    concerning     Santiago-Ramos'\n\nretaliation     claim       is    that     Rivera     allegedly   proposed      a\n\ndiscriminatory policy, Santiago-Ramos stated her opposition of the\n\npolicy to Rivera, and Santiago-Ramos was later fired.              The parties\n\ndispute whether Mayberry ever knew about Santiago-Ramos' opposition\n\nto the policy; however, this dispute is immaterial to resolution of\n\nthe issue.      Assuming Mayberry did know about her opposition,\nSantiago-Ramos has pointed to no evidence, save the decisionmakers'\n\nknowledge of Santiago-Ramos' opposition to the policy, suggesting\n\nthat her dismissal occurred in retaliation for her opposition. \"It\nis insufficient for [one] to simply recount that [one] complained\n\nand . . . was disciplined . . . .\"                  Id.   Because there is no\n\nevidence that Santiago-Ramos' dismissal occurred in retaliation for\n\nher opposition to Rivera's job fair profile, we affirm summary\n\njudgment for Centennial on Santiago-Ramos' retaliation claim.                 See\n\nid.\n\n                                          V\n\n           The last issue is whether the magistrate judge erred in\ndenying Santiago-Ramos' motion for summary judgment on her Puerto\n\nRico Law   80     claims.        Santiago-Ramos'     motion   argued   that   the\n\n                                         -21-\n\fprobationary contract she signed was void and, therefore, that she\n\nwas entitled to payment for 4.5 vacation days that she accumulated\n\nbefore her employment was terminated. Centennial opposed Santiago-\nRamos' motion, arguing that it was filed after the date the\n\nmagistrate judge set for the filing of dispositive motions and,\n\nalternatively, that the probationary contract was valid.                                  The\nmagistrate judge denied Santiago-Ramos' motion.\n\n               We    first       turn     to     Centennial's      argument      that    the\n\nmagistrate judge should not have entertained Santiago-Ramos' tardy\n\nmotion.        We    review       case        management    decisions      for   abuse     of\n\ndiscretion, giving district courts wide latitude.                         Rosario-Díaz v.\n\nGonzález, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998).                         A party adversely\n\naffected by a district court's case management decision thus \"bears\na formidable burden\" in seeking reversal.                         United States v. One\n\n1987 BMW 325, 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n               In    a    pretrial      conference,        the   magistrate      judge    set\nJanuary    15,       1998,       as    the    deadline     for    dispositive     motions.\n\nSantiago-Ramos'           motion        for     partial    summary    judgment,         filed\nMarch    17,    1998,       was       obviously    late.         However,    despite      its\n\ntardiness, the magistrate judge chose to entertain the motion,\n\nsuggesting that the issues contained therein were related to issues\n\ndiscussed       in       Santiago-Ramos'          simultaneous      and     timely      filed\n\nopposition to Centennial's motion for summary judgment. Based upon\n\nthat    fact,       as    well    as     the    relatively       straightforward        issue\n\npresented in the motion, we hold that the magistrate judge did not\n\nabuse his discretion by entertaining the motion.\n\n\n                                                -22-\n\f            We thus examine the magistrate judge's summary judgment\n\ndecision on the merits.        Puerto Rico Law 80 provides the exclusive\n\nremedy under Puerto Rico law for an employee who is discharged\nwithout demonstrating just cause.                 29 L.P.R.A. §§ 185a-185m.\n\nPursuant to Law 80, dismissed at-will employees are entitled to\n\ncertain benefits, including payment for vacation time accrued and\nnot enjoyed due to work demands.          Id. § 185a; Beauchamp v. Holsum\n\nBakers of P.R., Inc., 16 P.R. Offic. Trans. 641, 116 D.P.R. 522\n\n(1985).      However,    an    employee     who    is   terminated   during    a\n\nprobationary contract period is not entitled to those benefits. 29\n\nL.P.R.A. § 185h. A probationary contract must, among other things,\n\nbe \"made in writing, stating the date on which said probationary\n\nperiod commences and ends, which in no case shall exceed three (3)\nmonths.\"     Id.   The term \"month\" is defined as \"a period of thirty\n\n(30) consecutive calendar days.\"            Id.    If the contract does not\n\n\"comply with the above conditions,\" a court must \"render it null\nand void.\"    Id.\n\n            The probationary contract Santiago-Ramos signed stated it\n\nwas a 90-calendar day contract, commencing July 1, 1996, and ending\n\nSeptember    30,    1996.      However,     the    period   from   July   1   to\n\nSeptember 30 is 92 days, not 90 days.             Santiago-Ramos argues this\n\nerror makes the probationary contract void, inasmuch as it violates\n\nthe mandate in section 185h: a probationary contract never extends\n\nmore than 90 days.          Centennial argues that the error should be\n\noverlooked, inasmuch as the contract also states it was for 90\n\ndays.     Alternatively, Centennial points out that the 90th day of\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fthe probationary contract fell on a Saturday, and that continuing\n\nthe deadline through until Monday, September 30, 1996, would be\n\nconsistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a), which allows\ndeadlines to be carried over past weekends and legal holidays.\n\nFinally, Centennial argues that the parties intended to enter a\n\n90-day probationary contract, and pursuant to 31 L.P.R.A. § 3471,\nif the words of a contract \"should appear contrary to the evident\n\nintention of the contracting parties, the intention shall prevail.\"\n\n            The parties have not cited, and our research has not\n\nuncovered, any Puerto Rico or federal case law interpreting the\n\n90-day time limitation in section 185h.            We must therefore do so\n\nourselves.      We interpret a Puerto Rico statute according to its\n\nplain meaning.       A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading and Prod.\n\nCorp., 202 F.3d 469, 473 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The statute plainly states that a probationary contract\n\nmust specify \"the date on which [it] commences and ends,\" and that\nthe stated period \"in no case shall exceed three (3) months,\"\n\nmeaning three periods of \"thirty (30) consecutive calendar days.\"\n29   L.P.R.A.    §   185h.   Section    185h     contemplates   probationary\n\ncontracts that are less than 90 days, but it is clear that no\n\nprobationary contract may extend longer than 90 days. Section 185h\n\nis also straightforward that noncompliance with its requirements\n\n\"shall render [the contract] null and void.\"          Id.   Santiago-Ramos'\n\ncontract,    while    purporting   to   be   a   90-day   contract,   clearly\n\nincluded a time period of 92 days, making it invalid.            Centennial\n\ncites no authority for its argument that we can construe a contract\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fgoverned by Puerto Rico law with reference to the time deadline\n\nprovisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.     Further, we\n\ncannot ignore the plain language of the statute in order to give\nmeaning to the parties' contractual intent.\n\n            Because the contract states that it is a 90-day contract\n\nand also that it extends for 92 days, the party's actual intent is\nunclear.    Centennial points to no other documentary or testimonial\n\nevidence of the parties' actual intent in entering into this\n\ncontract.    We are bound to apply the plain language of Puerto Rico\n\nstatutory law, which is strict in mandating that a probationary\n\ncontract that by its terms extends beyond 90 days be declared void.\n\nWe thus reverse the magistrate judge's denial of Santiago-Ramos'\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment.\n            Santiago-Ramos is entitled to costs on appeal.\n\n            AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f",

Davila-Perez v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 202 F.3d 464, 466 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Centennial, a subsidiary of New Jersey-based Centennial Cellular Corp. (parent  company), is a telecommunications business that began operations in Puerto Rico in early 1996. Amaury Rivera, Centennial's vice president and general manager, and Thomas Bucks, chief financial  officer and comptroller of the parent company, interviewed Santiago-Ramos for a position as  Centennial's director of finance and administration.  Rivera gave Santiago-Ramos a written job offer  dated June 12, 1996, which she accepted and returned as requested.  Santiago-Ramos was chosen  over two male applicants and received several work assignments before formally beginning work on  July 1, 1996.  She also signed a 90-day probationary contract dated July 1, but she disputes that the  probationary contract is valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos was the only female among Centennial's four high-level executives. She was responsible for Centennial's finance, certain personnel matters (including oversight  responsibility for the drafting and implementation of an employee manual), and some inventory  assignments.  Because Centennial was beginning operations in Puerto Rico, all employees'  responsibilities were somewhat fluid and all were expected to work more than the normal 40-hour  work week.  Santiago-Ramos reported directly to Rivera in Puerto Rico and to Bucks at the parent  company.  Phil Mayberry, the parent company's senior vice president for Puerto Rico operations, was  Rivera's direct supervisor and oversaw all Puerto Rico operations from his parent company office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time she worked for Centennial, Santiago-Ramos had one child and planned  to have another child within several years.  After beginning work, she was directly asked about her  ability to balance work and family obligations.  In one instance, Rivera asked Santiago-Ramos  whether it was possible for her to handle simultaneously her job, child care, and marital  responsibilities.  Several times, he questioned how her husband was managing, considering she was  not home to cook for him.  The questions were not asked only by Rivera:  two weeks before she was  dismissed, Mayberry asked Santiago-Ramos how well her work was proceeding in light of her child. She responded that her work was going well and that she planned to have a second child within  several years.  Mayberry stated that having another child was a lot of work, and he questioned  whether Santiago-Ramos could perform her job effectively after having a second child.  She  responded that she would be able to meet both work and family obligations.  Santiago-Ramos sensed  that Mayberry disliked her response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another incident directly involved Santiago-Ramos, Rivera, and Mayberry.  During  Santiago-Ramos' tenure at Centennial, the company planned a major job fair at which a large number  of employees would be hired.  In preparation for the event, Rivera met with Santiago-Ramos and an  advertising consultant.  Rivera discussed a profile he drafted identifying the people the company was  and was not interested in hiring.  The profile purportedly excluded from consideration as Centennial  employees older persons with heavy non-work commitments, married women, and women with  children.  Rivera told Santiago-Ramos that the profile was \"nothing personal against you,\" but that  he preferred unmarried, childless women because they would give 150% to the job.  Later in this  meeting, Rivera telephoned Mayberry, read the profile to him, and Mayberry approved it.  Santiago-Ramos told Rivera that she opposed the profile, stating it was discriminatory.  However, she never  reported her objection to Mayberry or any other parent company representative.  She did not actually  see the profile, and questions regarding marriage and children were not included on the interview  questionnaire used at the job fair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor were these the only comments made by Rivera and Mayberry concerning women  employees and pregnancy.  For instance, Rivera allowed Santiago-Ramos to choose his new  secretary.  Santiago-Ramos hired Toni Mejas, a mother of two.  When Rivera later discovered that  Mejas had two children, he questioned Santiago-Ramos about whether her choice was a good one. On another occasion, Mayberry and a number of employees from the parent company visited Puerto  Rico to assist in the Centennial job fair.  Upon noticing that Santiago-Ramos was speaking with  another female employee, Mayberry called out to nearby male employees, \"guys watch out with the  females, next thing we know they will be running the company.\"  Also, Mejas heard Mayberry state  that he did not like women with children working at Centennial.  Other evidence puts Mayberry's  comments in perspective:  Bucks testified in a deposition that it did not surprise him that Mayberry  questioned whether women with children could fulfill work responsibilities, and Rivera referred to  Mayberry as a \"big time machista.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayberry and Rivera were not the only Centennial and parent company employees  who made comments about women, work, and children.  We relate several instances by way of  illustration.  Two employees in Santiago-Ramos' department stated that a secretary at Centennial who  was on maternity leave should not have become pregnant so soon after joining the company and that  she would most likely be fired as a result.  These same employees told Santiago-Ramos and Mejas  separately that they should not get pregnant or they would be fired.  On a trip Santiago-Ramos took  for training at the parent company, one of the parent company's directors complained to Santiago-Ramos that his secretary stopped working late after having children, and \"that is what happens when  we hire females in the child-bearing years.\"  A parent company employee, who came to Puerto Rico  to assist with the job fair, told Santiago-Ramos that he was \"in the interviewing mood,\" and asked  her in front of a number of other employees how long she had been married, how many children she  had, and what their ages were.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During her three months' employment at Centennial, several problems occurred that  Centennial, at least partially, attributes to her.  First, when a shipment of 500 telephones crucial to  Centennial's telecommunications operations arrived, five telephones, with a combined value of $2000,  were missing.  Santiago-Ramos had inventory responsibility over this shipment, and that these units  were missing was not discovered until several days after the telephones arrived.  Second, Centennial  incurred demurrage charges on a shipment containing communications towers because they were  picked up at the San Juan docks late.  However, Santiago-Ramos denies that she was responsible for  ensuring that the towers were properly received.  Third, electrical service was cut off at several  Centennial locations because utility bills were unpaid.  Santiago-Ramos was responsible to pay these  bills, and Centennial bore reconnect charges to restore power.  Fourth, the Centennial employee  manual, over which Santiago-Ramos had ultimate oversight responsibility, was not completed during  her employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Centennial was a start-up company, its employees were under constant  evaluation.  Nevertheless, neither Bucks nor Rivera ever told Santiago-Ramos that her work was  unsatisfactory.  When Santiago-Ramos came to the parent company for training two weeks before  her dismissal, Mayberry stated that he had no intention of firing her.  Rivera reported that up to the  day Mayberry instructed him to do so, he also had no intention of firing her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 1996, Santiago-Ramos' 89th day of employment with Centennial,  Mayberry told Rivera to dismiss her.  Rivera did so without providing Santiago-Ramos an  explanation.  The events leading up to that decision are not entirely clear.  For instance, Bucks  testified in his deposition that he, Rivera, and Mayberry jointly discussed Santiago-Ramos'  employment during the preceding week and collectively agreed that her employment should be  terminated.  Mayberry stated that he discussed firing Santiago-Ramos and his rationale for doing so  several times with Rivera.  However, Rivera recalls only one conversation, held the day Mayberry  told him to fire Santiago-Ramos.  The record contains a memorandum Rivera wrote dated September  27, 1996, stating that Santiago-Ramos was dismissed and identifying four reasons for doing so;  however, Mejas, who typed the memorandum from Rivera's dictation, testified in a deposition that  the memorandum was not prepared on September 27, and was only written after Santiago-Ramos  initiated legal proceedings against Centennial.  It is clear, however, that Santiago-Ramos'  responsibilities were assumed by other employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos filed this action and, after extensive discovery, Centennial moved for  summary judgment.  Santiago-Ramos moved for partial summary judgment on several of her Puerto  Rico law claims.  The magistrate judge granted Centennial's motion for summary judgment, denied  Santiago-Ramos' motion for partial summary judgment, refused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction  over the Puerto Rico law claims, and entered judgment for Centennial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute whether the magistrate judge properly applied the summary  judgment standard.  \"We review summary judgment de novo, viewing the entire record in the light  most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that  party's favor.\"  Davila-Perez, 202 F.3d at 466 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Summary  judgment is appropriate only if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\" and \"the moving  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  \"A dispute is genuine if the  evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the  non-moving party.  A fact is material if it carries with it the potential to affect the outcome of the suit  under the applicable law.\"  Sanchez v. Alvarado, 101 F.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal  quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The moving party \"bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the  basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the  absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). \"Once the moving party has properly supported [its] motion for summary judgment, the burden shifts  to the nonmoving party, with respect to each issue on which [it] has the burden of proof, to  demonstrate that a trier of fact reasonably could find in [its] favor.\"  DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d  298, 306 (1st Cir. 1997), citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-25.  In opposing summary judgment, the  nonmoving party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [the] pleading, but must set  forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue\" of material fact as to each issue upon which  he or she would bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.  242, 256 (1986) (internal quotations, citation, and alteration omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address one other issue before the merits.  Santiago-Ramos filed a sworn affidavit,  in addition to documentary evidence and transcripts of portions of depositions, in her opposition to  Centennial's motion for summary judgment.  Santiago-Ramos cited her affidavit frequently in her  argument.  Both Centennial and the magistrate judge fault her for doing so, stating that the self-serving statements, produced after her receipt of Centennial's summary judgment motion, should be  given less credibility than other evidence in the record.  Centennial cites Wright and Miller, Federal  Practice and Procedure &#167;&#167; 2722, 2738 (1998), for the proposition that judges should afford less  weight to affidavits than to deposition testimony when deciding summary judgment motions. Santiago-Ramos relies on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, which states that affidavits may be used  in supporting and opposing motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law regarding this dispute is clear.  To the extent that affidavits submitted in  opposition to a motion for summary judgment merely reiterate allegations made in the complaint,  without providing specific factual information made on the basis of personal knowledge, they are  insufficient.  Roslindale Coop. Bank v. Greenwald, 638 F.2d 258, 261 (1st Cir. 1981), citing Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56(e).  However, a \"party's own affidavit, containing relevant information of which he has  first-hand knowledge, may be self-serving, but it is nonetheless competent to support or defeat  summary judgment.\"  Cadle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957, 961 n.5 (1st Cir. 1997), citing Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 706 (1st Cir. 1993).  Santiago-Ramos' affidavit  contains more than the allegations made in her complaint:  it provides specific factual information  based upon her personal knowledge.  It may be self-serving, but it complies with the requirements  of the federal rules, and we therefore must consider it together with the other evidence before the  magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue is whether the magistrate judge erred in granting summary judgment  to Centennial on Santiago-Ramos' sex discrimination claim.  Title VII makes it \"an unlawful  employment practice for an employer . . . to discharge any individual . . . because of such individual's  . . . sex.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1).  If the employer's decision is made \"because of or on the basis  of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,\" it is made \"because of sex.\"  Id. &#167; 2000e(k). A Title VII sex discrimination claim may be proven with direct evidence of discrimination, such as  \"an admission by the employer that it explicitly took actual or anticipated pregnancy into account in  reaching an employment decision.\"  Smith v. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 421 (1st Cir. 1996).  Such  \"smoking gun\" evidence is rare, but sex discrimination may also be proven with circumstantial  evidence.  Domnguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 428-29 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When considering circumstantial evidence of sex discrimination, we apply a three-stage, burden-shifting framework that was first articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411  U.S. 792 (1973), and further delineated in Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450  U.S. 248 (1981), and St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502 (1993).  The analysis \"is  intended progressively to sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual question of intentional  discrimination.\"  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255 n.8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An employee alleging sex discrimination must first establish a prima facie case by  showing that:  (1) she belonged to a protected class, (2) she performed her job satisfactorily, (3) her  employer took an adverse employment decision against her, and (4) her employer continued to have  her duties performed by a comparably qualified person.  Smith, 76 F.3d at 421.  This task \"is not  onerous,\"  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, and can result in a rebuttable presumption \"that the employer  unlawfully discriminated against the employee.\"  Id. at 254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three elements of Santiago-Ramos' prima facie case are clearly met:  she is a woman;  she was fired; and comparable persons continued to perform her work responsibilities.  Whether  Santiago-Ramos performed her job satisfactorily at Centennial is not as clear.  However, we need not  reach this issue because of our second inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second stage, the burden shifts to the employer to state a legitimate,  nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.  Hicks, 509 U.S. at 506-07.  The  employer's burden is merely a burden of production; the employee maintains the burden of proof  throughout.  Id. at 507.  If the employer meets its burden, the presumption of discrimination  evaporates.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Centennial advanced the following nondiscriminatory reasons for firing Santiago-Ramos:  (1) the missing phones incident; (2) the communications towers demurrage charges; (3) the  unpaid electrical bills; (4) failure to complete the employee manual; (5) her general attitude and lack  of commitment.  Santiago-Ramos concedes that these reasons are sufficient to drop the inference of  discrimination that she contends arose from the first step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the third stage, with the initial presumption of discrimination removed, it falls upon  the employee to \"present sufficient evidence to show both that the employer's articulated reason . . .  is a pretext and that the true reason is discriminatory.\"  Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38,  56 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1174 (2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \"Plaintiffs may use the same evidence to support both conclusions, provided that the evidence is  adequate to enable a rational factfinder reasonably to infer that unlawful discrimination was a  determinative factor in the adverse employment action.\"  Id. at 57 (internal quotations and citations  omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must decide \"whether, viewing the aggregate package of proof offered by  [Santiago-Ramos] and taking all inferences in [her] favor, [Santiago-Ramos] has raised a genuine  issue of fact as to whether the termination was motivated by [sex] discrimination.\"  Domnguez-Cruz,  202 F.3d at 431 (citations and quotations omitted).  If there is sufficient evidence in the record from  which a jury could infer that Centennial's proffered reasons for firing Santiago-Ramos were pretextual  and that it made its decision because of discriminatory animus, summary judgment is inappropriate. See id.  We first address whether evidence of pretext exists, having in mind that courts should  exercise particular caution before granting summary judgment for employers on such issues as  pretext, motive, and intent.  Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 167 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos can establish that Centennial's stated reasons for her dismissal are a  pretext for discrimination in a number of ways.  One method is to show that discriminatory comments  were made by the key decisionmaker or those in a position to influence the decisionmaker.  Mulero-Rodrguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 675-76 (1st Cir. 1996).  There is evidence that Mayberry,  head of Puerto Rico operations for the parent company, was the key decisionmaker in the termination  of Santiago-Ramos' employment.  It is also clear that Rivera, Santiago-Ramos' direct supervisor and  general manager in Puerto Rico, was in a position to influence Mayberry in that decision.  Mayberry  was located at the parent company and Rivera was based in Puerto Rico.  The two held \"almost daily  conference calls\" during the crucial start-up phase when Santiago-Ramos worked at Centennial. Rivera testified that Mayberry called him for his opinion regarding Santiago-Ramos' dismissal.  Bucks  also testified that Rivera was involved in the decision.  This evidence is sufficient to support an  inference that Rivera was in a position to influence Mayberry, the key decisionmaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals a number of comments made by both Mayberry and Rivera  suggesting their concern about Santiago-Ramos possibly having a second child while working at  Centennial, as well as concern about women with children working at Centennial in general.  For  purposes of summary judgment, we cannot weigh the credibility of witnesses making these comments  and must assume they were made as stated.  DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 308, quoting Anderson, 477  U.S. at 249.  The magistrate judge reviewed Mayberry's and Rivera's comments and held that they  were \"stray remarks,\" insufficient to enable a jury to conclude that Centennial's reasons for dismissing  Santiago-Ramos were pretextual.  We do not read the record the same way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, two weeks prior to Santiago-Ramos' termination, she traveled to the  parent company for training.  At that time, Mayberry had no intention of firing her, despite knowing  of her work problems.  At a dinner held during the training, Mayberry specifically asked Santiago-Ramos about her ability to balance her current work and parental responsibilities.  In response to  Santiago-Ramos' response that she was balancing her duties well and that she would have another  child, Mayberry questioned Santiago-Ramos' ability to fulfill her work responsibilities should she have  a second child.  The subject matter of Mayberry's comments (Santiago-Ramos' ability to work as a  mother) coupled with Mayberry's previous impression of Santiago-Ramos (he was not inclined to fire  her), together with the timing of Santiago-Ramos' dismissal (just two weeks after Mayberry made the  comments), provides circumstantial evidence about the pretextual nature of Centennial's proffered  nondiscriminatory reasons for Santiago-Ramos' dismissal.  Such comments, made by Mayberry (the  key decisionmaker), together with similar comments from Rivera (one in a position to influence the  decisionmaker), could lead a jury to conclude that Centennial's proffered reasons for firing Santiago-Ramos were actually a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos also points to comments made by others at Centennial and the parent  company that illustrate a discriminatory attitude in the company as a whole.  Typically, statements  made by \"one who neither makes nor influences [a] challenged personnel decision are not probative  in an employment discrimination case.\"  Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5,  10 (1st Cir. 1990).  However, evidence of a company's general atmosphere of discrimination \"may  be considered along with any other evidence bearing on motive in deciding whether a Title VII  plaintiff has met her burden of showing that the defendants' reasons are pretexts.\"  Sweeney v. Board  of Trustees of Keene State College, 604 F.2d 106, 113 (1st Cir. 1979) (emphasis added).  As  recountedearlier, a number of other persons at Centennial and the parent company made comments  to Santiago-Ramos and others concerning the company's treatment of female employees with  children.  While these comments are not proof of discrimination against Santiago-Ramos, they \"add  'color' to the decision-making process at [Centennial] and to the reasons given for [her dismissal].\" Id.  A jury could reasonably rely upon these comments, together with other evidence such as  comments by the decisionmakers, in concluding that Centennial's explanations are pretextual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another method of establishing pretext is to show that Centennial's nondiscriminatory  reasons were after-the-fact justifications, provided subsequent to the beginning of legal action.  SeeMariani Giron v. Acevedo Ruiz, 834 F.2d 238, 239 (1st Cir. 1987) (section 1983 case); Lex K.  Larson, 1 Employment Discrimination &#167; 8.04 at 8-76 (2d ed. 2000).  A jury could interpret from the  timing of such comments that Centennial's reasons are pretextual.  On September 27, 1996, the date  of Santiago-Ramos' dismissal, Rivera did not tell her why her employment was being terminated.  A  memorandum dated that same day identifies several reasons for the decision.  However, Mejas, who  typed that memorandum from Rivera's dictation, stated that it was prepared several weeks subsequent  to the termination, after it was clear that Santiago-Ramos was initiating legal action against  Centennial.  A jury could rely upon Mejas' statement to conclude that Centennial's stated reasons for  firing Santiago-Ramos were merely pretextual post hoc justifications because they were only provided  in anticipation of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos can also establish pretext by showing \"weaknesses, implausibilities,  inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons\" such  that a factfinder could \"infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory  reasons.\"  Hodgens, 144 F.3d at 168 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  A factfinder could  do so here.  First, as the magistrate judge held, the evidence regarding the demurrage charges  Centennial incurred because of the tardy receipt of the communications towers suggests that this  reason could be considered pretextual.  There is evidence that Santiago-Ramos was never assigned  responsibility to pick up the towers, that she was unaware that the towers had arrived in Puerto Rico  before she was dismissed, and that no one had reprimanded her about the towers incident during her  tenure with Centennial.  Second, Centennial cites the missing telephone incident as an important  reason for firing Santiago-Ramos, stating that the telephones were crucial to its start-up operations. However, at the time the incident occurred, Rivera told Santiago-Ramos that it was \"a minor matter.\" That the incident was minor to Rivera is supported by his assertion that he had no intention to fire  her before being told to do so.  Third, Centennial now stresses Santiago-Ramos' failure to complete  the employee manual as a reason for her dismissal, although that problem did not appear in Rivera's  memorandum regarding Santiago-Ramos' dismissal.  The record reveals that Santiago-Ramos had  ultimate oversight responsibility for the completion of the manual and that before Santiago-Ramos'  dismissal Mayberry expressed concern that it was not completed.  However, there is also evidence,  from both Santiago-Ramos and Lourdes Lucas, the parent company's legal counsel, that Centennial's  outside legal counsel was asked to provide a first draft of the manual and that revisions would have  to be made to that draft.  Santiago-Ramos testified that outside counsel was tardy in providing the  first draft and that the revision process was underway when she was fired.  Based upon these  weaknesses in the nondiscriminatory reasons Centennial provided, the jury could find that the reasons  were pretextual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having discussed whether Centennial's nondiscriminatory reasons were pretextual, we  now address whether the record contains sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus.  Domnguez-Cruz, 202 F.3d at 431.  There is sufficient evidence here.  For instance, after Santiago-Ramos told  Mayberry that she was planning on having a second child in the next several years, he specifically  questioned whether she would be able to manage her work and family responsibilities; shortly  thereafter, her employment was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the evidence in the light most favorable to Santiago-Ramos, Domnguez-Cruz, 202 F.3d at 433, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence from which a  reasonable jury could find that Centennial's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for her dismissal  were pretextual and that the actual reason was discriminatory.  Our view of the facts at this point is  necessarily shaped by the summary judgment standard of review and is only \"a description of the  permissible inferences that could be drawn from the facts and that suffice to defeat summary  judgment.\"  Id.  Indeed, after the full presentation of the evidence at trial, a factfinder might very well  decide differently.  But Santiago-Ramos has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the actual  reason for her dismissal, and this suffices to allow her to present her sex discrimination case at trial. We reverse the magistrate judge on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next issue is whether the magistrate judge erred in granting summary judgment  to Centennial on Santiago-Ramos' retaliation claim.  Pursuant to Title VII:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to  discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has  opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by  this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified,  assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation,  proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a).  A prima facie case of retaliation is made by a showing that:  (1) the  employee engaged in conduct that Title VII protects; (2) the employee suffered an adverse  employment action; and (3) the adverse action is causally connected to the protected activity. Hernandez-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos argues that she was fired because she opposed the job fair profile  Rivera presented, which allegedly excluded older persons with commitments, pregnant women, and  women with children.  There is evidence that Rivera proposed such a policy and that Santiago-Ramos  opposed it.  However, there is also evidence that Santiago-Ramos never reported her concerns to  Mayberry or anyone else at the parent company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a retaliation claim \"to survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must  point to evidence in the record that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the  employment action was retaliatory.\"  King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 968 (1st Cir. 1997). Even assuming that Santiago-Ramos established the first two elements of the retaliation prima facie  case, the magistrate judge correctly granted summary judgment on this claim because Santiago-Ramos has not established the third element:  that her dismissal was causally related to her opposition  to the job fair profile.  The only evidence concerning Santiago-Ramos' retaliation claim is that Rivera  allegedly proposed a discriminatory policy, Santiago-Ramos stated her opposition of the policy to  Rivera, and Santiago-Ramos was later fired.  The parties dispute whether Mayberry ever knew about  Santiago-Ramos' opposition to the policy; however, this dispute is immaterial to resolution of the  issue.  Assuming Mayberry did know about her opposition, Santiago-Ramos has pointed to no  evidence, save the decisionmakers' knowledge of Santiago-Ramos' opposition to the policy,  suggesting that her dismissal occurred in retaliation for her opposition.  \"It is insufficient for [one]  to simply recount that [one] complained and . . . was disciplined . . . .\"  Id.  Because there is no  evidence that Santiago-Ramos' dismissal occurred in retaliation for her opposition to Rivera's job fair  profile, we affirm summary judgment for Centennial on Santiago-Ramos' retaliation claim.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last issue is whether the magistrate judge erred in denying Santiago-Ramos'  motion for summary judgment on her Puerto Rico Law 80 claims.  Santiago-Ramos' motion argued  that the probationary contract she signed was void and, therefore, that she was entitled to payment  for 4.5 vacation days that she accumulated before her employment was terminated.  Centennial  opposed Santiago-Ramos' motion, arguing that it was filed after the date the magistrate judge set for  the filing of dispositive motions and, alternatively, that the probationary contract was valid.  The  magistrate judge denied Santiago-Ramos' motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first turn to Centennial's argument that the magistrate judge should not have  entertained Santiago-Ramos' tardy motion.  We review case management decisions for abuse of  discretion, giving district courts wide latitude.  Rosario-Daz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir.  1998).  A party adversely affected by a district court's case management decision thus \"bears a  formidable burden\" in seeking reversal.  United States v. One 1987 BMW 325, 985 F.2d 655, 657  (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pretrial conference, the magistrate judge set January 15, 1998, as the deadline for  dispositive motions.  Santiago-Ramos' motion for partial summary judgment, filed March 17, 1998,  was obviously late.  However, despite its tardiness, the magistrate judge chose to entertain the  motion, suggesting that the issues contained therein were related to issues discussed in Santiago-Ramos' simultaneous and timely filed opposition to Centennial's motion for summary judgment. Based upon that fact, as well as the relatively straightforward issue presented in the motion, we hold  that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion by entertaining the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus examine the magistrate judge's summary judgment decision on the merits. Puerto Rico Law 80 provides the exclusive remedy under Puerto Rico law for an employee who is  discharged without demonstrating just cause.  29 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 185a-185m.  Pursuant to Law 80,  dismissed at-will employees are entitled to certain benefits, including payment for vacation time  accrued and not enjoyed due to work demands.  Id. &#167; 185a; Beauchamp v. Holsum Bakers of P.R.,  Inc., 16 P.R. Offic. Trans. 641, 116 D.P.R. 522 (1985).  However, an employee who is terminated  during a probationary contract period is not entitled to those benefits.  29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185h.  A  probationary contract must, among other things, be \"made in writing, stating the date on which said  probationary period commences and ends, which in no case shall exceed three (3) months.\"  Id.  The  term \"month\" is defined as \"a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days.\"  Id.  If the contract  does not \"comply with the above conditions,\" a court must \"render it null and void.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probationary contract Santiago-Ramos signed stated it was a 90-calendar day  contract, commencing July 1, 1996, and ending September 30, 1996.  However, the period from July  1 to September 30 is 92 days, not 90 days.  Santiago-Ramos argues this error makes the probationary  contract void, inasmuch as it violates the mandate in section 185h:  a probationary contract never  extends more than 90 days.  Centennial argues that the error should be overlooked, inasmuch as the  contract also states it was for 90 days.  Alternatively,Centennial points out that the 90th day of the  probationary contract fell on a Saturday, and that continuing the deadline through until Monday,  September 30, 1996, would be consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a), which allows  deadlines to be carried over past weekends and legal holidays.  Finally, Centennial argues that the  parties intended to enter a 90-day probationary contract, and pursuant to 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 3471, if the  words of a contract \"should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the  intention shall prevail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have not cited, and our research has not uncovered, any Puerto Rico or  federal case law interpreting the 90-day time limitation in section 185h.  We must therefore do so  ourselves.  We interpret a Puerto Rico statute according to its plain meaning.  A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading and Prod. Corp., 202 F.3d 469, 473 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute plainly states that a probationary contract must specify \"the date on which  [it] commences and ends,\" and that the stated period \"in no case shall exceed three (3) months,\"  meaning three periods of \"thirty (30) consecutive calendar days.\"  29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185h.  Section 185h  contemplates probationary contracts that are less than 90 days, but it is clear that no probationary  contract may extend longer than 90 days.  Section 185h is also straightforward that noncompliance  with its requirements \"shall render [the contract] null and void.\"  Id.  Santiago-Ramos' contract, while  purporting to be a 90-day contract, clearly included a time period of 92 days, making it invalid. Centennial cites no authority for its argument that we can construe a contract governed by Puerto  Rico law with reference to the time deadline provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Further, we cannot ignore the plain language of the statute in order to give meaning to the parties'  contractual intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the contract states that it is a 90-day contract and also that it extends for 92  days, the party's actual intent is unclear.  Centennial points to no other documentary or testimonial  evidence of the parties' actual intent in entering into this contract.  We are bound to apply the plain  language of Puerto Rico statutory law, which is strict in mandating that a probationary contract that  by its terms extends beyond 90 days be declared void.  We thus reverse the magistrate judge's denial  of Santiago-Ramos' motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos is entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>    Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(parent  company), is a telecommunications business that began operations in Puerto Rico in early 1996. Amaury Rivera, Centennial's vice president and general manager, and Thomas Bucks, chief financial  officer and comptroller of the parent company, interviewed Santiago-Ramos for a position as  Centennial's director of finance and administration.  Rivera gave Santiago-Ramos a written job offer  dated June 12, 1996, which she accepted and returned as requested.  Santiago-Ramos was chosen  over two male applicants and received several work assignments before formally beginning work on  July 1, 1996.  She also signed a 90-day probationary contract dated July 1, but she disputes that the  probationary contract is valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos was the only female among Centennial's four high-level executives. She was responsible for Centennial's finance, certain personnel matters (including oversight  responsibility for the drafting and implementation of an employee manual), and some inventory  assignments.  Because Centennial was beginning operations in Puerto Rico, all employees'  responsibilities were somewhat fluid and all were expected to work more than the normal 40-hour  work week.  Santiago-Ramos reported directly to Rivera in Puerto Rico and to Bucks at the parent  company.  Phil Mayberry, the parent company's senior vice president for Puerto Rico operations, was  Rivera's direct supervisor and oversaw all Puerto Rico operations from his parent company office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time she worked for Centennial, Santiago-Ramos had one child and planned  to have another child within several years.  After beginning work, she was directly asked about her  ability to balance work and family obligations.  In one instance, Rivera asked Santiago-Ramos  whether it was possible for her to handle simultaneously her job, child care, and marital  responsibilities.  Several times, he questioned how her husband was managing, considering she was  not home to cook for him.  The questions were not asked only by Rivera:  two weeks before she was  dismissed, Mayberry asked Santiago-Ramos how well her work was proceeding in light of her child. She responded that her work was going well and that she planned to have a second child within  several years.  Mayberry stated that having another child was a lot of work, and he questioned  whether Santiago-Ramos could perform her job effectively after having a second child.  She  responded that she would be able to meet both work and family obligations.  Santiago-Ramos sensed  that Mayberry disliked her response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another incident directly involved Santiago-Ramos, Rivera, and Mayberry.  During  Santiago-Ramos' tenure at Centennial, the company planned a major job fair at which a large number  of employees would be hired.  In preparation for the event, Rivera met with Santiago-Ramos and an  advertising consultant.  Rivera discussed a profile he drafted identifying the people the company was  and was not interested in hiring.  The profile purportedly excluded from consideration as Centennial  employees older persons with heavy non-work commitments, married women, and women with  children.  Rivera told Santiago-Ramos that the profile was \"nothing personal against you,\" but that  he preferred unmarried, childless women because they would give 150% to the job.  Later in this  meeting, Rivera telephoned Mayberry, read the profile to him, and Mayberry approved it.  Santiago-Ramos told Rivera that she opposed the profile, stating it was discriminatory.  However, she never  reported her objection to Mayberry or any other parent company representative.  She did not actually  see the profile, and questions regarding marriage and children were not included on the interview  questionnaire used at the job fair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor were these the only comments made by Rivera and Mayberry concerning women  employees and pregnancy.  For instance, Rivera allowed Santiago-Ramos to choose his new  secretary.  Santiago-Ramos hired Toni Mejas, a mother of two.  When Rivera later discovered that  Mejas had two children, he questioned Santiago-Ramos about whether her choice was a good one. On another occasion, Mayberry and a number of employees from the parent company visited Puerto  Rico to assist in the Centennial job fair.  Upon noticing that Santiago-Ramos was speaking with  another female employee, Mayberry called out to nearby male employees, \"guys watch out with the  females, next thing we know they will be running the company.\"  Also, Mejas heard Mayberry state  that he did not like women with children working at Centennial.  Other evidence puts Mayberry's  comments in perspective:  Bucks testified in a deposition that it did not surprise him that Mayberry  questioned whether women with children could fulfill work responsibilities, and Rivera referred to  Mayberry as a \"big time machista.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayberry and Rivera were not the only Centennial and parent company employees  who made comments about women, work, and children.  We relate several instances by way of  illustration.  Two employees in Santiago-Ramos' department stated that a secretary at Centennial who  was on maternity leave should not have become pregnant so soon after joining the company and that  she would most likely be fired as a result.  These same employees told Santiago-Ramos and Mejas  separately that they should not get pregnant or they would be fired.  On a trip Santiago-Ramos took  for training at the parent company, one of the parent company's directors complained to Santiago-Ramos that his secretary stopped working late after having children, and \"that is what happens when  we hire females in the child-bearing years.\"  A parent company employee, who came to Puerto Rico  to assist with the job fair, told Santiago-Ramos that he was \"in the interviewing mood,\" and asked  her in front of a number of other employees how long she had been married, how many children she  had, and what their ages were.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During her three months' employment at Centennial, several problems occurred that  Centennial, at least partially, attributes to her.  First, when a shipment of 500 telephones crucial to  Centennial's telecommunications operations arrived, five telephones, with a combined value of $2000,  were missing.  Santiago-Ramos had inventory responsibility over this shipment, and that these units  were missing was not discovered until several days after the telephones arrived.  Second, Centennial  incurred demurrage charges on a shipment containing communications towers because they were  picked up at the San Juan docks late.  However, Santiago-Ramos denies that she was responsible for  ensuring that the towers were properly received.  Third, electrical service was cut off at several  Centennial locations because utility bills were unpaid.  Santiago-Ramos was responsible to pay these  bills, and Centennial bore reconnect charges to restore power.  Fourth, the Centennial employee  manual, over which Santiago-Ramos had ultimate oversight responsibility, was not completed during  her employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Centennial was a start-up company, its employees were under constant  evaluation.  Nevertheless, neither Bucks nor Rivera ever told Santiago-Ramos that her work was  unsatisfactory.  When Santiago-Ramos came to the parent company for training two weeks before  her dismissal, Mayberry stated that he had no intention of firing her.  Rivera reported that up to the  day Mayberry instructed him to do so, he also had no intention of firing her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 1996, Santiago-Ramos' 89th day of employment with Centennial,  Mayberry told Rivera to dismiss her.  Rivera did so without providing Santiago-Ramos an  explanation.  The events leading up to that decision are not entirely clear.  For instance, Bucks  testified in his deposition that he, Rivera, and Mayberry jointly discussed Santiago-Ramos'  employment during the preceding week and collectively agreed that her employment should be  terminated.  Mayberry stated that he discussed firing Santiago-Ramos and his rationale for doing so  several times with Rivera.  However, Rivera recalls only one conversation, held the day Mayberry  told him to fire Santiago-Ramos.  The record contains a memorandum Rivera wrote dated September  27, 1996, stating that Santiago-Ramos was dismissed and identifying four reasons for doing so;  however, Mejas, who typed the memorandum from Rivera's dictation, testified in a deposition that  the memorandum was not prepared on September 27, and was only written after Santiago-Ramos  initiated legal proceedings against Centennial.  It is clear, however, that Santiago-Ramos'  responsibilities were assumed by other employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos filed this action and, after extensive discovery, Centennial moved for  summary judgment.

Santiago-Ramos filed a sworn affidavit,  in addition to documentary evidence and transcripts of portions of depositions, in her opposition to  Centennial's motion for summary judgment.  Santiago-Ramos cited her affidavit frequently in her  argument.  Both Centennial and the magistrate judge fault her for doing so, stating that the self-serving statements, produced after her receipt of Centennial's summary judgment motion, should be  given less credibility than other evidence in the record.  Centennial cites Wright and Miller, Federal  Practice and Procedure &#167;&#167; 2722, 2738 (1998), for the proposition that judges should afford less  weight to affidavits than to deposition testimony when deciding summary judgment motions. Santiago-Ramos relies on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, which states that affidavits may be used  in supporting and opposing motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law regarding this dispute is clear.  To the extent that affidavits submitted in  opposition to a motion for summary judgment merely reiterate allegations made in the complaint,  without providing specific factual information made on the basis of personal knowledge, they are  insufficient.  Roslindale Coop. Bank v. Greenwald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"386000\"><a href=\"/opinion/386000/roslindale-cooperative-bank-v-carol-s-greenwald/\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 261 (1st Cir. 1981), citing Fed.

Santiago-Ramos' affidavit  contains more than the allegations made in her complaint:  it provides specific factual information  based upon her personal knowledge.

If the employer's decision is made \"because of or on the basis  of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,\" it is made \"because of sex.\"  Id. &#167; 2000e(k).

One method is to show that discriminatory comments  were made by the key decisionmaker or those in a position to influence the decisionmaker.  Mulero-Rodrguez v. Ponte, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728081\"><a href=\"/opinion/728081/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-406-69-empl-prac-dec-p-44437-gilberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span>, 675-76 (1st Cir. 1996).  There is evidence that Mayberry,  head of Puerto Rico operations for the parent company, was the key decisionmaker in the termination  of Santiago-Ramos' employment.  It is also clear that Rivera, Santiago-Ramos' direct supervisor and  general manager in Puerto Rico, was in a position to influence Mayberry in that decision.  Mayberry  was located at the parent company and Rivera was based in Puerto Rico.  The two held \"almost daily  conference calls\" during the crucial start-up phase when Santiago-Ramos worked at Centennial. Rivera testified that Mayberry called him for his opinion regarding Santiago-Ramos' dismissal.  Bucks  also testified that Rivera was involved in the decision.  This evidence is sufficient to support an  inference that Rivera was in a position to influence Mayberry, the key decisionmaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals a number of comments made by both Mayberry and Rivera  suggesting their concern about Santiago-Ramos possibly having a second child while working at  Centennial, as well as concern about women with children working at Centennial in general.  For  purposes of summary judgment, we cannot weigh the credibility of witnesses making these comments  and must assume they were made as stated.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746214\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">DeNovellis,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/746214/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1520-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45029-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, quoting <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Anderson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>.  The magistrate judge reviewed Mayberry's and Rivera's comments and held that they  were \"stray remarks,\" insufficient to enable a jury to conclude that Centennial's reasons for dismissing  Santiago-Ramos were pretextual.  We do not read the record the same way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, two weeks prior to Santiago-Ramos' termination, she traveled to the  parent company for training.  At that time, Mayberry had no intention of firing her, despite knowing  of her work problems.  At a dinner held during the training, Mayberry specifically asked Santiago-Ramos about her ability to balance her current work and parental responsibilities.  In response to  Santiago-Ramos' response that she was balancing her duties well and that she would have another  child, Mayberry questioned Santiago-Ramos' ability to fulfill her work responsibilities should she have  a second child.  The subject matter of Mayberry's comments (Santiago-Ramos' ability to work as a  mother) coupled with Mayberry's previous impression of Santiago-Ramos (he was not inclined to fire  her), together with the timing of Santiago-Ramos' dismissal (just two weeks after Mayberry made the  comments), provides circumstantial evidence about the pretextual nature of Centennial's proffered  nondiscriminatory reasons for Santiago-Ramos' dismissal.  Such comments, made by Mayberry (the  key decisionmaker), together with similar comments from Rivera (one in a position to influence the  decisionmaker), could lead a jury to conclude that Centennial's proffered reasons for firing Santiago-Ramos were actually a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos also points to comments made by others at Centennial and the parent  company that illustrate a discriminatory attitude in the company as a whole.  Typically, statements  made by \"one who neither makes nor influences [a] challenged personnel decision are not probative  in an employment discrimination case.\"  Medina-Munoz v. R.J.

However, evidence of a company's general atmosphere of discrimination \"may  be considered along with any other evidence bearing on motive in deciding whether a Title VII  plaintiff has met her burden of showing that the defendants' reasons are pretexts.\"  Sweeney v.

As  recountedearlier, a number of other persons at Centennial and the parent company made comments  to Santiago-Ramos and others concerning the company's treatment of female employees with  children.  While these comments are not proof of discrimination against Santiago-Ramos, they \"add  'color' to the decision-making process at [Centennial] and to the reasons given for [her dismissal].\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369075\"><a href=\"/opinion/369075/20-fair-emplpraccas-759-20-empl-prac-dec-p-30221-christine-m/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  A jury </a></span>could reasonably rely upon these comments, together with other evidence such as  comments by the decisionmakers, in concluding that Centennial's explanations are pretextual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another method of establishing pretext is to show that Centennial's nondiscriminatory  reasons were after-the-fact justifications, provided subsequent to the beginning of legal action.  SeeMariani Giron v.

Larson, 1 Employment Discrimination &#167; 8.04 at 8-76 (2d ed. 2000).  A jury could interpret from the  timing of such comments that Centennial's reasons are pretextual.  On September 27, 1996, the date  of Santiago-Ramos' dismissal, Rivera did not tell her why her employment was being terminated.  A  memorandum dated that same day identifies several reasons for the decision.  However, Mejas, who  typed that memorandum from Rivera's dictation, stated that it was prepared several weeks subsequent  to the termination, after it was clear that Santiago-Ramos was initiating legal action against  Centennial.  A jury could rely upon Mejas' statement to conclude that Centennial's stated reasons for  firing Santiago-Ramos were merely pretextual post hoc justifications because they were only provided  in anticipation of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos can also establish pretext by showing \"weaknesses, implausibilities,  inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons\" such  that a factfinder could \"infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory  reasons.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197958\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hodgens,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197958/hodgens-v-general-dynamics-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">168</span> </a></span>(internal quotations and citations omitted).  A factfinder could  do so here.  First, as the magistrate judge held, the evidence regarding the demurrage charges  Centennial incurred because of the tardy receipt of the communications towers suggests that this  reason could be considered pretextual.  There is evidence that Santiago-Ramos was never assigned  responsibility to pick up the towers, that she was unaware that the towers had arrived in Puerto Rico  before she was dismissed, and that no one had reprimanded her about the towers incident during her  tenure with Centennial.  Second, Centennial cites the missing telephone incident as an important  reason for firing Santiago-Ramos, stating that the telephones were crucial to its start-up operations. However, at the time the incident occurred, Rivera told Santiago-Ramos that it was \"a minor matter.\" That the incident was minor to Rivera is supported by his assertion that he had no intention to fire  her before being told to do so.  Third, Centennial now stresses Santiago-Ramos' failure to complete  the employee manual as a reason for her dismissal, although that problem did not appear in Rivera's  memorandum regarding Santiago-Ramos' dismissal.  The record reveals that Santiago-Ramos had  ultimate oversight responsibility for the completion of the manual and that before Santiago-Ramos'  dismissal Mayberry expressed concern that it was not completed.  However, there is also evidence,  from both Santiago-Ramos and Lourdes Lucas, the parent company's legal counsel, that Centennial's  outside legal counsel was asked to provide a first draft of the manual and that revisions would have  to be made to that draft.  Santiago-Ramos testified that outside counsel was tardy in providing the  first draft and that the revision process was underway when she was fired.  Based upon these  weaknesses in the nondiscriminatory reasons Centennial provided, the jury could find that the reasons  were pretextual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having discussed whether Centennial's nondiscriminatory reasons were pretextual, we  now address whether the record contains sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Domnguez-Cruz,</span> <span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">431</span></span>.  There is sufficient evidence here.  For instance, after Santiago-Ramos told  Mayberry that she was planning on having a second child in the next several years, he specifically  questioned whether she would be able to manage her work and family responsibilities; shortly  thereafter, her employment was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the evidence in the light most favorable to Santiago-Ramos, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Domnguez-Cruz,</span> <span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">433</span></span>, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence from which a  reasonable jury could find that Centennial's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for her dismissal  were pretextual and that the actual reason was discriminatory.  Our view of the facts at this point is  necessarily shaped by the summary judgment standard of review and is only \"a description of the  permissible inferences that could be drawn from the facts and that suffice to defeat summary  judgment.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Indeed, after </span>the full presentation of the evidence at trial, a factfinder might very well  decide differently.  But Santiago-Ramos has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the actual  reason for her dismissal, and this suffices to allow her to present her sex discrimination case at trial. We reverse the magistrate judge on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next issue is whether the magistrate judge erred in granting summary judgment  to Centennial on Santiago-Ramos' retaliation claim.  Pursuant to Title VII:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to  discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has  opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by  this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified,  assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation,  proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a).  A prima facie case of retaliation is made by a showing that:  (1) the  employee engaged in conduct that Title VII protects; (2) the employee suffered an adverse  employment action; and (3) the adverse action is causally connected to the protected activity. Hernandez-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198161\"><a href=\"/opinion/198161/hernandez-torres-v-intercontinental/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos argues that she was fired because she opposed the job fair profile  Rivera presented, which allegedly excluded older persons with commitments, pregnant women, and  women with children.  There is evidence that Rivera proposed such a policy and that Santiago-Ramos  opposed it.  However, there is also evidence that Santiago-Ramos never reported her concerns to  Mayberry or anyone else at the parent company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a retaliation claim \"to survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must  point to evidence in the record that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the  employment action was retaliatory.\"  King v. Town of Hanover, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742622\"><a href=\"/opinion/742622/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1266-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44807-bruce-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 968 (1st Cir. 1997). Even assuming that Santiago-Ramos established the first two elements of the retaliation prima facie  case, the magistrate judge correctly granted summary judgment on this claim because Santiago-Ramos has not established the third element:  that her dismissal was causally related to her opposition  to the job fair profile.  The only evidence concerning Santiago-Ramos' retaliation claim is that Rivera  allegedly proposed a discriminatory policy, Santiago-Ramos stated her opposition of the policy to  Rivera, and Santiago-Ramos was later fired.  The parties dispute whether Mayberry ever knew about  Santiago-Ramos' opposition to the policy; however, this dispute is immaterial to resolution of the  issue.  Assuming Mayberry did know about her opposition, Santiago-Ramos has pointed to no  evidence, save the decisionmakers' knowledge of Santiago-Ramos' opposition to the policy,  suggesting that her dismissal occurred in retaliation for her opposition.  \"It is insufficient for [one]  to simply recount that [one] complained and . . . was disciplined . . . .\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742622\"><a href=\"/opinion/742622/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1266-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44807-bruce-h/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Because there </a></span>is no  evidence that Santiago-Ramos' dismissal occurred in retaliation for her opposition to Rivera's job fair  profile, we affirm summary judgment for Centennial on Santiago-Ramos' retaliation claim.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last issue is whether the magistrate judge erred in denying Santiago-Ramos'  motion for summary judgment on her Puerto Rico Law 80 claims.  Santiago-Ramos' motion argued  that the probationary contract she signed was void and, therefore, that she was entitled to payment  for 4.5 vacation days that she accumulated before her employment was terminated.  Centennial  opposed Santiago-Ramos' motion, arguing that it was filed after the date the magistrate judge set for  the filing of dispositive motions and, alternatively, that the probationary contract was valid.  The  magistrate judge denied Santiago-Ramos' motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first turn to Centennial's argument that the magistrate judge should not have  entertained Santiago-Ramos' tardy motion.  We review case management decisions for abuse of  discretion, giving district courts wide latitude.  Rosario-Daz v. Gonzalez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197880\"><a href=\"/opinion/197880/rosario-diaz-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 315 (1st Cir.  1998).  A party adversely affected by a district court's case management decision thus \"bears a  formidable burden\" in seeking reversal.  United States v. One 1987 BMW 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600264\"><a href=\"/opinion/600264/no-92-1827/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 657  (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pretrial conference, the magistrate judge set January 15, 1998, as the deadline for  dispositive motions.  Santiago-Ramos' motion for partial summary judgment, filed March 17, 1998,  was obviously late.  However, despite its tardiness, the magistrate judge chose to entertain the  motion, suggesting that the issues contained therein were related to issues discussed in Santiago-Ramos' simultaneous and timely filed opposition to Centennial's motion for summary judgment. Based upon that fact, as well as the relatively straightforward issue presented in the motion, we hold  that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion by entertaining the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus examine the magistrate judge's summary judgment decision on the merits. Puerto Rico Law 80 provides the exclusive remedy under Puerto Rico law for an employee who is  discharged without demonstrating just cause.  29 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 185a-185m.  Pursuant to Law 80,  dismissed at-will employees are entitled to certain benefits, including payment for vacation time  accrued and not enjoyed due to work demands.  Id. &#167; 185a; Beauchamp v. Holsum Bakers of P.R.,  Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></span>, 116 D.P.R. 522 (1985).  However, an employee who is terminated  during a probationary contract period is not entitled to those benefits.  29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185h.  A  probationary contract must, among other things, be \"made in writing, stating the date on which said  probationary period commences and ends, which in no case shall exceed three (3) months.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The  term </span>\"month\" is defined as \"a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  If the </span>contract  does not \"comply with the above conditions,\" a court must \"render it null and void.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probationary contract Santiago-Ramos signed stated it was a 90-calendar day  contract, commencing July 1, 1996, and ending September 30, 1996.  However, the period from July  1 to September 30 is 92 days, not 90 days.  Santiago-Ramos argues this error makes the probationary  contract void, inasmuch as it violates the mandate in section 185h:  a probationary contract never  extends more than 90 days.  Centennial argues that the error should be overlooked, inasmuch as the  contract also states it was for 90 days.  Alternatively,Centennial points out that the 90th day of the  probationary contract fell on a Saturday, and that continuing the deadline through until Monday,  September 30, 1996, would be consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a), which allows  deadlines to be carried over past weekends and legal holidays.  Finally, Centennial argues that the  parties intended to enter a 90-day probationary contract, and pursuant to 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 3471, if the  words of a contract \"should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the  intention shall prevail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have not cited, and our research has not uncovered, any Puerto Rico or  federal case law interpreting the 90-day time limitation in section 185h.  We must therefore do so  ourselves.  We interpret a Puerto Rico statute according to its plain meaning.  A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading and Prod. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198810\"><a href=\"/opinion/198810/capens-v-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 473 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute plainly states that a probationary contract must specify \"the date on which  [it] commences and ends,\" and that the stated period \"in no case shall exceed three (3) months,\"  meaning three periods of \"thirty (30) consecutive calendar days.\"  29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185h.  Section 185h  contemplates probationary contracts that are less than 90 days, but it is clear that no probationary  contract may extend longer than 90 days.  Section 185h is also straightforward that noncompliance  with its requirements \"shall render [the contract] null and void.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Santiago-Ramos' contract, </span>while  purporting to be a 90-day contract, clearly included a time period of 92 days, making it invalid. Centennial cites no authority for its argument that we can construe a contract governed by Puerto  Rico law with reference to the time deadline provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Further, we cannot ignore the plain language of the statute in order to give meaning to the parties'  contractual intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the contract states that it is a 90-day contract and also that it extends for 92  days, the party's actual intent is unclear.  Centennial points to no other documentary or testimonial  evidence of the parties' actual intent in entering into this contract.  We are bound to apply the plain  language of Puerto Rico statutory law, which is strict in mandating that a probationary contract that  by its terms extends beyond 90 days be declared void.  We thus reverse the magistrate judge's denial  of Santiago-Ramos' motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Ramos is entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>    Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
