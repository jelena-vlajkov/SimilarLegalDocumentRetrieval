POISSON\r\n                   FOR NICHOLAS D. POISSON,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n        COMMISSIONER, SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n        [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Matthew B. Cox and Burns, Bryant, Hinchey, Cox &amp; Rockefeller,\r\nP.A. on brief for appellant.\r\n   Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, Arthur J. Fried,\r\nGeneral Counsel, Charlotte J. Hardnett, Principal Deputy General\r\nCounsel, John M. Sacchetti, Associate General Counsel, and Karen J.\r\nAviles, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nDecember 11, 1998\r\n\n    Per Curiam.  In this action for a retroactive award of\r\nchild's insurance benefits, claimant Karen Poisson, on behalf\r\nof her son Nicholas, appeals from a judgment dismissing the\r\nsuit for lack of jurisdiction.  The district court based its\r\ndecision on Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 107-09 (1977),\r\nwhich held that the Commissioner's denial of a request to\r\nreopen an earlier claim is ordinarily not subject to judicial\r\nreview.  While this rule is not without exception, claimant has\r\nadvanced no reason why it should not apply here.  We therefore\r\naffirm. \r\n    On July 1, 1989, several weeks after claimant became\r\npregnant, her boyfriend Daniel Gagne was tragically killed in\r\na motorcycle accident (without learning of the pregnancy). \r\nNicholas was born on March 15, 1990.  Soon thereafter, claimant\r\napplied for child's benefits but was unable to prove Gagne's\r\npaternity.  Her claim was thus denied both initially (on May 6,\r\n1990) and on reconsideration (four months later); no further\r\nreview was sought.  Instead, allegedly heeding advice given to\r\nher by agency personnel, claimant turned to state court in an\r\nattempt to obtain a paternity decree.  On November 8, 1994, a\r\nsettlement was reached with Gagne's parents (and approved by\r\nthe court) acknowledging that Gagne was Nicholas' father.\r\n    Armed with this new evidence, claimant filed a second\r\napplication for child's benefits on November 10, 1994--only to\r\ndiscover that she had missed, by some six months, the four-year\r\ndeadline for reopening her first claim.  See 20 C.F.R. \r\n404.988(b) (permitting reopening for \"good cause\" within four\r\nyears of date of notice of initial determination); id. \r\n404.989(a)(1) (defining good cause to include \"new and material\r\nevidence\").  As a result, she was successful only in part.  The\r\nagency agreed to award benefits on a prospective basis\r\n(commencing in May 1994), but refused to reopen the first\r\napplication so that benefits could be awarded retroactively to\r\n1990.  Claimant sought review of this latter ruling, first\r\nbefore an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and then before the\r\nAppeals Council, but to no avail.  Her ensuing federal court\r\naction, as mentioned, was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \r\nClaimant now appeals from this determination.\r\n    In contending that the district court had jurisdiction to\r\nentertain her suit, claimant advances a pair of contentions. \r\nFirst, she argues that she has satisfied the exception\r\nrecognized by the Sanders Court for claims involving a\r\ncolorable constitutional issue.  See 430 U.S. at 109.  Yet the\r\nconstitutional claim she attempted to articulate below--that\r\nthe Commissioner effectively requires that illegitimate\r\nchildren establish paternity solely by way of a court order, in\r\ncontravention of due process and equal protection--is factually\r\nbelied by the record.  And the separate claim she appears to be\r\nadvancing on appeal--that the immutable nature of paternity\r\nrenders the denial of retroactive benefits in this context\r\narbitrary and irrational--was not raised below, is\r\nunaccompanied by developed argumentation, and appears dubious. \r\nCf. Shepherd ex rel. Shepherd v. Chater, 932 F. Supp. 1314,\r\n1317-18 (D. Utah 1996) (upholding statutory twelve-month limit\r\non retroactive child's benefits against constitutional attack).\r\n    Alternatively, claimant asserts that because the 1990 and\r\n1994 applications both hinged on the issue of paternity, the\r\nCommissioner \"constructively\" reopened the former when he\r\nfavorably addressed the latter.  And to that extent, claimant\r\nargues, the decision is subject to review.  See, e.g., McGowen\r\nv. Harris, 666 F.2d 60, 65-66 (4th Cir. 1981).  Admittedly, it\r\nis difficult to dispute that \"[t]he ALJ of necessity\r\nreconsidered the merits of the earlier claim when granting the\r\nlater one, because the claims were identical.\"  Bolden ex rel.\r\nBolden v. Bowen, 868 F.2d 916, 918 (7th Cir. 1989); accord\r\nWhitlock v. Chater, 959 F. Supp. 324, 331 (W.D. Va. 1997).  As\r\na result, if a reopening were possible here, it might well be\r\nappropriate to conclude that a de facto reopening had occurred\r\n(despite the ALJ's specific language to the contrary).  Cf.\r\nTaylor ex rel. Peck v. Heckler, 738 F.2d 1112, 1114-15 (10th\r\nCir. 1984) (finding de facto reopening where first and second\r\nclaim, filed three years apart, were each rejected for\r\ninsufficient proof of paternity).\r\n    Yet we need not decide that issue, inasmuch as a reopening\r\nwas not authorized here.  Claimant did not satisfy any of the\r\ncriteria in 20 C.F.R.  404.988(c) permitting reopening \"at any\r\ntime.\"  See, e.g., Robinson v. Heckler, 783 F.2d 1144, 1146 n.3\r\n(4th Cir. 1986).  And as mentioned, she missed the four-year\r\ndeadline that governs reopenings for \"good cause.\"  It is well\r\nsettled that the Commissioner lacks discretion to reopen a\r\nclaim, whether on a de facto basis or otherwise, except as\r\npermitted by regulation.  See, e.g., King v. Chater, 90 F.3d\r\n323, 325 (8th Cir. 1996); Boock v. Shalala, 48 F.3d 348, 352\r\n(8th Cir. 1995) (Campbell, J., sitting by designation, for the\r\ncourt); Coates ex rel. Coates v. Bowen, 875 F.2d 97, 102 (7th\r\nCir. 1989).  And in circumstances similar to those here, courts\r\nhave relied on this same rationale to withhold retroactive\r\nchild's benefits where paternity (or dependency) was only\r\nestablished in a subsequent claim filed more than four years\r\nafter the first.  See, e.g., Hall v. Chater, 52 F.3d 518, 520-\r\n21 (4th Cir. 1995); Bolden, 868 F.2d at 917-19; Robinson, 783\r\nF.2d at 1146; Whitlock, 959 F. Supp. at 332.\r\n    Such a result is admittedly harsh.  We note, for example,\r\nthat claimant has acted with reasonable diligence throughout. \r\nMore important, as she emphasizes, the fact of paternity cannot\r\nchange over time.  Nonetheless, the administration of social\r\nwelfare programs requires prophylactic rules, which unavoidably\r\nwill often fit only roughly when applied to individual\r\nsituations.  See, e.g., Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 769\r\n(1975).  Because the applicable rules prohibit a reopening\r\nhere, we conclude that no de facto reopening occurred.  We\r\ntherefore agree that the district court was without\r\njurisdiction in light of the Sanders decision.\r\n    Affirmed.\n",
