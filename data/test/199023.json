Albert Kenrick and Derek Ober\n\nappeal from judgments of conviction entered after a jury trial\n\nin   the   United   States   District     Court   for    the   District    of\n\nMassachusetts.      The jury found Kenrick guilty of one count of\n\nbank fraud and Ober guilty of four counts of bank fraud and one\n\ncount of perjury.      They argue, for the first time on appeal,\n\nthat the district court erred in instructing the jury on the\n\nintent required for a bank fraud conviction.            Although the panel\n\nthat originally heard this case agreed with the defendants, it\n\nheld that there was no plain error warranting reversal.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Kenrick, No. 98-1282, slip op. at 22, 33 (1st\n\nCir. Feb. 22, 2000) (withdrawn).           A majority of the circuit\n\njudges in active regular service ordered rehearing en banc and\n\nrequested supplemental briefs on the intent issue.             We now hold\n\nthat, contrary to the defendants' argument and the earlier\n\nholding of the panel, \"intent to harm\" is not an element of bank\n\nfraud.     We take this opportunity to clarify the nature of the\n\nintent element required for a bank fraud conviction.               We also\n\nreject both defendants' challenges to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, as well as sundry arguments raised by Ober.                     We\n\ntherefore affirm the convictions.\n\n                             I.   BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\njury's verdict.      See United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d\n\n148, 157 (1st Cir. 1999).              In 1986, at the height of \"New\n\nEngland's late, lamented real estate boom,\"             United States v.\n\nLilly, 983 F.2d 300, 302 (1st Cir. 1992), Derek Ober was the\n\npresident of the Wakefield Cooperative Bank (\"WCB\" or \"the\n\nbank\") in Wakefield, Massachusetts.            WCB is a state-chartered\n\nbank that has been insured by the FDIC since January 1986.\n\nAlbert Kenrick, a real estate investor with substantial property\n\nin eastern Massachusetts, who had done business with WCB in the\n\npast, had an incentive to sell real estate in which he had large\n\ngains before January 1, 1987, because of a pending increase in\n\ncapital gains taxes.\n\nA.   222 Stackpole Street\n\n            Among    Kenrick's    properties     was   an    eighteen-unit\n\napartment    building     at     222    Stackpole   Street    in   Lowell,\n\nMassachusetts.       Kenrick discussed with Emily Flynn, a real\n\nestate broker whom he had dated in the past, the possibility of\n\nconverting the building to condominiums and having Flynn sell\n\nthem for him.       Possibly contemplating the tax advantages of a\n\nsale before the end of 1986, however, Kenrick decided to sell\n\nthe apartment building.        Flynn had recently made a large profit\n\non another condominium conversion, and she was interested in\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fbuying the Stackpole Street building with a partner.                  Although\n\nshe wanted to have the same partner that she had had on her\n\nrecent successful condo deal, Kenrick told her that Ober--whom\n\nFlynn      had   never   met   before--was     interested     in    buying    the\n\nproperty and that Kenrick preferred that Flynn and Ober purchase\n\nit as partners.          On October 5, 1986, Flynn cooked a spaghetti\n\ndinner for Kenrick and Ober, and they negotiated a price for the\n\nStackpole Street property of $935,000.\n\n             Flynn asked Ober where they could get financing for the\n\npurchase, and he answered, \"Right here at this bank,\" i.e., WCB.\n\nOber instructed Flynn that the loan application should be made\n\nin her name alone, even though they were equal partners, because\n\nhe was going through a divorce.            When she expressed doubt that\n\nshe alone could qualify for such a large loan, he assured her\n\nthat she could, and he filled out the application for her.                   Ober\n\ncalled John (Jay) Kimball, a lawyer who frequently represented\n\nWCB   in    mortgage     transactions,   and    asked   him    to   handle    the\n\npaperwork for the Stackpole Street purchase.                  Kimball drafted\n\nthe Riverview Development Trust, with Flynn as the trustee and\n\nonly listed beneficiary, to hold title to the property.                        On\n\nOber's instructions, Kimball also told Kenrick's attorney, who\n\nhad drafted a purchase and sale agreement listing both Flynn and\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fOber as purchasers, that Flynn was to be listed as the only\n\nbuyer.\n\n            An application for a $900,000 mortgage on the Stackpole\n\nStreet property was filed with WCB.           Pursuant to the standard\n\nprocedure for mortgage applications at WCB, the applications\n\nwent initially to Ober, who was both president and the bank's\n\nsole loan officer.     The applications were then reviewed by two\n\nmembers of the Security Committee, a subcommittee of the Board\n\nof Directors, who set a value for the property, typically by\n\nvisiting    it   themselves,   without   an   outside   appraisal.   If\n\napproved by the Security Committee, loans would come before the\n\nBoard of Directors at its monthly meeting for ratification.\n\nThere was an unwritten policy that Board members should abstain\n\nfrom voting on loans in which they or their relatives had an\n\ninterest.\n\n            Ober and another member of the Security Committee\n\nvisited Stackpole Street, valued the property at $1,125,000, and\n\nrecommended approval of the mortgage.         The minutes of the Board\n\nof Directors meeting of November 26, 1986, indicate that the\n\nBoard approved the Flynn loan.           Three members of the Board,\n\nhowever, testified that the loan was never presented to them for\n\na vote and that Ober never disclosed to them his interest in the\n\nproperty.    An FBI document analyst testified that the entry in\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe Board minutes listing the loan was typed at a different time\n\nand with a different typewriter ball or wheel than the rest of\n\nthe page.\n\n            The transaction closed on December 24, 1986.                  WCB\n\nprovided a check for $900,000 and Flynn took title to the\n\nproperty as trustee of the Riverview Development Trust.               Flynn\n\nherself provided the $50,000 down payment because Ober said he\n\ncould not pay his half due to his pending divorce.             The property\n\nwas converted to condominiums, and seventeen of the eighteen\n\nunits sold quickly, allowing Flynn to pay off the WCB loan in\n\neight months.     She shared the substantial profits equally with\n\nOber, after repaying herself her contribution of his portion of\n\nthe down payment.       Ober assisted Flynn throughout the sales\n\nprocess,    and   managed   to   sell   several   units   to    friends   and\n\nacquaintances, most of whom financed their purchases through WCB\n\nmortgages.\n\n            The eighteenth unit was harder to sell.            Title to that\n\nunit was transferred to another trust prepared by Attorney\n\nKimball, the D & E Realty Trust.          Ober told Kimball that he had\n\nan interest in the unsold unit.         Kimball therefore prepared two\n\nstatements of beneficial interest for the trust, one listing\n\nFlynn as 100% beneficiary and the other listing Ober as 100%\n\nbeneficiary; according to Flynn, they were equal partners in D\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f& E as in Riverview.          Ober was present when the trust was\n\nexecuted.    He received half the net income from D & E and dealt\n\nwith a condominium owner whose unit was damaged by flooding in\n\nthe unit owned by D & E.\n\n            From the beginning of the transaction, Ober took steps\n\nto conceal his interest in 222 Stackpole Street.              He arranged\n\nthat Flynn should take title from Kenrick in her name only, as\n\ntrustee of the Riverview Development Trust, and that she should\n\nbe listed as the sole borrower on the $900,000 loan from WCB to\n\npurchase    the   property.    Ober   had   a   motive   to   conceal   his\n\ninterest because, as the jury was told, a loan of that nature to\n\na bank officer was forbidden by Massachusetts law.              See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 170, § 19.1     When Flynn was deposed by the attorney\n\nfor the former Mrs. Ober, Ober instructed her to perjure herself\n\nby stating that he had no interest in the Stackpole Street\n\nproperty, and she did so.       Before Flynn was questioned by the\n\nFBI, Ober told her, \"I'll never admit to anything.\"             Ober also\n\ndenied his involvement in the Stackpole Street transaction at a\n\n1991 WCB Board meeting.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n     The jury was also told that the Federal Reserve Board's\nRegulation O required a bank officer to disclose his interest in\na loan to the bank's board of directors and to abstain from\nvoting on the loan. See 12 C.F.R. pt. 215.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fB.    8-10 Emerson Street\n\n            At around the same time that he sold the Stackpole\n\nStreet property, Kenrick sold a six-unit apartment building\n\nlocated at 8-10 Emerson Street in Wakefield to Chung Lee and her\n\nparents.    The Lees were Korean immigrants who had formerly lived\n\nin a different building owned by Kenrick.         They had purchased a\n\ntwo-family house on Willow Street in Melrose, Massachusetts, in\n\n1983.    Kenrick, who was dating Chung Lee, told her that he could\n\nteach her how to make a million dollars by investing in real\n\nestate.     He suggested to her that she and her parents buy his\n\nEmerson Street building for $325,000.        He advised financing the\n\npurchase with two loans from WCB: first, a $150,000 refinancing\n\nof the mortgage on the Willow Street property, which would\n\nprovide money for the down payment, and then a $260,000 mortgage\n\non 8-10 Emerson Street.\n\n            Although Chung Lee filled out an application for the\n\nWillow Street refinancing and filed it at WCB, it was not acted\n\nupon immediately.     The original application was marked \"Hold\" in\n\nOber's handwriting.      After Kenrick met with Ober to negotiate\n\nthe     Stackpole   Street   sale,    however,   the   refinancing   was\n\napproved, with the commitment letter dated October 22, 1986.\n\nKenrick himself filled out the application for the Lees' Emerson\n\nStreet mortgage, and his appointment calendar indicated that he\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fgave it to Ober personally on November 3, 1986.                    The Board of\n\nDirectors ratified the Willow Street loan on November 26 and the\n\nEmerson Street loan on December 18.                 The sale of 8-10 Emerson\n\nStreet closed on December 18.\n\n            As alleged by the government, there was evidence of a\n\nquid-pro-quo agreement between Kenrick and Ober that Kenrick\n\nwould sell 222 Stackpole Street to Flynn and Ober and, in\n\nexchange, Ober would provide financing through the bank to allow\n\nKenrick to sell 8-10 Emerson Street to the Lees.                   Following his\n\nspaghetti dinner meeting with Flynn and Ober on October 5, 1986,\n\nwhere they    negotiated the Stackpole Street deal, Kenrick made\n\na note that \"I agreed at 935,000 to keep good rapport with Derek\n\nand thought with his financing ability & Emily's condo sales\n\nexperience    we    could       all     be   happy.\"        In   Kenrick's     1986\n\nappointment calendar, otherwise filled with detailed notes for\n\nmost days of the year, the page for October 4-6 is missing.\n\nWithin   three     weeks    of    the    October    5   meeting    the     loan   to\n\nrefinance the Lee family's property on Willow Street in Melrose,\n\nsubmitted    to    WCB     in    August      and   marked    \"Hold\"   in     Ober's\n\nhandwriting, had been approved; within two more weeks, the\n\napplication for the $260,000 mortgage for the Lees to purchase\n\n8-10 Emerson Street had been completed by Kenrick and delivered\n\nby him to Ober.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f          In addition, the agreement between Ober and Kenrick was\n\ntestified to by Chung Lee.       She testified that Kenrick told her,\n\nin explaining why he sold 222 Stackpole Street to Flynn and\n\nOber, that \"Mr. Ober can lend me the money because he's the Bank\n\nPresident.   So, you know, that will work out very well.\"              When\n\nasked what the relationship was between the Stackpole Street\n\ndeal and Kenrick's sale of other properties, including 8-10\n\nEmerson Street, she answered first, \"Well, because if Bert\n\n[Kenrick] helps Derek Ober, Derek Ober can help Bert to sell\n\nother properties.\"       When asked again what Kenrick had said about\n\nthe relationship between the different deals, she answered:\n\n          Because Bert sold it to Derek, Stackpole\n          Street, that's why he can sell his Tuttle\n          Street commercial properties.     And 8-10\n          Emerson Street, he can sell.    And he can\n          also sell Methuen property at 175 Haverhill\n          Street, for I think, a million dollars or\n          $900,000.   I cannot remember.  But he can\n          sell that because Bert help Derek Ober to\n          make money. That way, you know, he can help\n          Bert later.\n\n          Chung Lee married Kenrick in October 1988 and was still\n\nmarried to him at the time of trial in October 1997, although\n\ndivorce proceedings were then pending.              She and her parents\n\ncontinued to own the Emerson Street property, but had to obtain\n\nan   additional   loan    from   WCB   to   cover   cash   flow   problems.\n\nEventually, after the tenants were forced to move out when Chung\n\nLee (now Chung Kenrick) contaminated the building in attempting\n\n                                   -11-\n\fto remove lead paint, she defaulted on the mortgage and filed\n\nfor bankruptcy.      The bank wrote off a loss of $119,645.84 on the\n\nEmerson Street mortgage.\n\nC.     DGB Realty Trust\n\n            In September 1985, Ober formed the DGB Realty Trust\n\nwith WCB Treasurer Glenn Gates and William Upton, a retired\n\nlocal police officer.        DGB bought three condominium units in\n\nHudson,    Massachusetts,     and   financed   the     purchases    through\n\nGreater Boston Bank.        DGB lost money from the start, and its\n\nchecking account at WCB soon contained insufficient money to pay\n\nthe trust's bills.         To cover the shortfall, Ober decided to\n\nissue a demand loan from WCB to DGB for $15,000 on December 4,\n\n1986.     On December 11, 1987, the amount of the demand loan was\n\nincreased to $25,000.        Although there was testimony that some\n\nbank    employees,   and   possibly   some   members    of   the   Board   of\n\nDirectors, knew of the interest of Ober and Gates in DGB, three\n\ndirectors testified that Ober did not disclose the demand loan\n\nto the Board.    In January 1988, the DGB demand loan was paid off\n\nwith the proceeds of a new demand loan in the name of William\n\nUpton.     Although the new loan was in Upton's name alone, Ober\n\nand Gates were still each responsible for one-third of the debt.\n\nOber and Upton paid off their shares, but Gates still owed money\n\non his at the time of trial.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            The demand loans did not turn DGB into a profitable\n\nventure, and on multiple occasions checks were written on DGB's\n\naccount at WCB although there were insufficient funds to cover\n\nthem.     At that time WCB did not offer its customers overdraft\n\nprotection or lines of credit.              If a check was presented for\n\npayment with insufficient funds in the account, customers were\n\ntypically allowed to make it good by depositing funds on the\n\nsame day the check was presented; if they could not, the check\n\nbounced.        Apparently checks were sometimes held for longer\n\nperiods    for    bank   employees     or   Board   members.    On     Ober's\n\ninstructions, however, DGB checks were held for unprecedented\n\nlengths    of    time,   after   the   checks    were   paid   and    without\n\nsufficient funds in DGB's account to cover them.                     Fourteen\n\nchecks, totaling over $36,000, were held for a total of 576\n\ndays; no checks bounced, and DGB payed no interest or fees.               The\n\nlast of these was the largest: check number 182, in the amount\n\nof $6,780.42, was presented for payment, and paid, on March 17,\n\n1988, but there were insufficient funds in the DGB account to\n\ncover it until January 6, 1989.\n\nD.   Ober Deposition\n\n            The WCB Board of Directors fired Ober and Gates amid\n\nallegations of misconduct in 1991.              In 1993, WCB brought an\n\naction against North American Specialty Insurance Company to\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\frecover on a fidelity bond for losses to the bank allegedly\n\ncaused by the fraudulent conduct of Ober, Gates, and Attorney\n\nKimball.   The suit was brought in Massachusetts Superior Court\n\nand removed by the defendant to the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts.        As a part of discovery in\n\nthat action, Ober, then living in Florida, was deposed under\n\noath on March 10 and 11, 1994.           Ober was asked, \"Now, Mr.\n\nKimball drew a realty trust entitled D, ampersand, E Realty\n\nTrust, D & E Realty Trust.       Are you familiar with that?\"        He\n\nanswered, \"No.\"    Ober was also asked, \"Did you ever participate\n\nin the making of a loan where you had an undisclosed interest?\"\n\nHe again answered, \"No.\"\n\nE.   Procedural History\n\n           A   federal   grand   jury   issued   a   twenty-two   count\n\nindictment against Kenrick and Ober on December 18, 1996.           The\n\nindictment charged Kenrick with conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. § 371,\n\nbank bribery, 18 U.S.C. § 215(a), and three counts of bank\n\nfraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1344.     It charged Ober with conspiracy, bank\n\nbribery, seventeen counts of bank fraud, and two counts of\n\nperjury, 18 U.S.C. § 1623.       The case was tried to a jury from\n\nSeptember 15 to October 27, 1997.       The jury found Kenrick guilty\n\non one count of bank fraud and Ober guilty on four counts of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fbank fraud and one count of perjury.     They were acquitted on all\n\nother counts.    This appeal followed.\n\n                II.   JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON BANK FRAUD\n\n         Kenrick and Ober argue that the district court erred\n\nby failing to instruct the jury that they could not be convicted\n\nof bank fraud unless they intended to harm WCB.2        Because they\n\nfailed to raise this objection before the district court, we\n\nreview for plain error.      See United States v. Robbio, 186 F.3d\n\n37, 42 (1st Cir. 1999); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\n         The defendants were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1344, which provides:\n\n         Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to\n         execute, a scheme or artifice--\n                (1)    to    defraud    a    financial\n                institution; or\n                (2) to obtain any of the moneys,\n                funds, credits, assets, securities,\n                or other property owned by, or under\n                the   custody   or   control   of,   a\n                financial institution, by means of\n\n\n    2This argument was raised more clearly before the panel by\nKenrick than by Ober, but Ober has joined in it in his\nsupplemental brief before the en banc court. To the extent that\nOber also makes a separate argument that the court erred by not\nrequiring proof that the bank in fact lost money as a result of\nhis conduct, he is clearly incorrect: section 1344 by its terms\npunishes not merely successful frauds, but any execution or\nattempted execution of a scheme to defraud a bank. See Neder v.\nUnited States, 527 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1999) (noting that common-law\nelement of damages \"plainly ha[s] no place in the federal fraud\nstatutes\"); United States v. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 65\n(1st Cir. 1999) (\"The government need not prove actual loss as\na result of the scheme . . . .\").\n\n                                 -15-\n\f                false   or   fraudulent   pretenses,\n                representations, or promises;\n         shall be [subject to a specified maximum\n         fine and term of imprisonment].3\n\nThe defendants object to a portion of the district court's\n\ninstruction defining a \"scheme to defraud\":\n\n         A   scheme   to   defraud    is   ordinarily\n         accompanied by a desire or a purpose to\n         bring about some gain or benefit to one's\n         self [sic] or some other person or by a\n         desire or purpose to cause some loss to some\n         other person. Here, there is not alleged--\n         effectively, there hasn't been any evidence\n         offered--that there was an intent to cause a\n         loss to some other person.      Here, we're\n         dealing with allegations that there was to\n         be some benefit to Mr. Ober, to Mr. Kenrick,\n         or to people that Mr. Kenrick was concerned\n         about.\n\nThe court also separately defined \"intent to defraud\":   \"To act\n\nwith intent to defraud means to act wilfully with a specific\n\nintent to deceive or cheat or for the purpose of either causing\n\nsome financial gain to another or one's self [sic].\"\n\n         The panel that first considered this case agreed with\n\nthe defendants that intent to defraud necessarily includes an\n\n\"intent to harm\" the bank, and that the district court erred by\n\nomitting this requirement from its jury instructions.   The panel\n\nfurther held that there was no plain error.       After further\n\n\n    3 For the sake of convenience we will refer to this current\nversion of § 1344, although the defendants were convicted under\na previous version that was different in some ways not relevant\nhere.\n\n                             -16-\n\fconsideration of the intent issue, the en banc court, including\n\nthe panel members, arrives at a different conclusion about the\n\nmeaning of intent to defraud.            We now hold, for the reasons set\n\nforth   below,     that   the    intent    necessary   for   a   bank    fraud\n\nconviction is an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain\n\nfrom it money or other property.\n\n            The panel addressed the intent question in the terms\n\nthat the defendants posed it--whether evidence of an intent to\n\ndeceive a bank and to enrich oneself or another person would\n\nsupport a bank fraud conviction without evidence of an intent to\n\nharm the bank.      The panel's answer that proof of intent to harm\n\nwas required was based on precedents from other circuits and an\n\ninterpretation of the opinion of the Supreme Court in McNally v.\n\nUnited States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), a case in which the Supreme\n\nCourt held that the mail fraud statute does not reach \"honest\n\nservices\" fraud.4         By its terms, however, McNally              does not\n\nrequire proof of \"intent to harm\" as an element of bank fraud,\n\nand there are no Supreme Court precedents that define the intent\n\nnecessary    for   a   bank     fraud   conviction.    There     is   also   no\n\n\n\n    4In 1988 Congress overturned the holding of McNally by\nenacting 18 U.S.C. § 1346, which defines \"'scheme or artifice to\ndefraud' [to] include[] a scheme or artifice to deprive another\nof the intangible right of honest services.\" Section 1346 is\ninapplicable here because the allegedly fraudulent acts in this\ncase took place before its effective date.\n\n                                        -17-\n\fconsensus    among   the    circuits   on   the   issue.   Moreover,   the\n\n\"intent to harm\" formulation of the panel contained an ambiguity\n\nthat could not be dispelled easily.5\n\n            In arriving at our formulation of the intent necessary\n\nfor a bank fraud conviction, we begin with the language of the\n\nbank fraud statute.        Because neither the indictment nor the jury\n\ninstructions specified the subsection of § 1344 under which\n\nKenrick and Ober were charged, we must examine both subsections.\n\nSection 1344(2) specifies an intent requirement.           It prescribes\n\na punishment for \"whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to\n\nexecute, a scheme or artifice . . . to obtain any of the monies,\n\nfunds, credits, assets, securities or other property owned by,\n\nor under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by\n\nmeans of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or\n\n\n\n\n    5In common usage, \"intent to harm\" may well be understood to\nmean a motive to cause the bank an ultimate financial loss. Of\ncourse, a court could explain to a jury that intent to harm had\nnothing to do with a motive to hurt a bank, and could explain\nfurther that the panel's broad definition of \"intent to harm\"\nincluded depriving a bank of the right to control its assets by\ndepriving it of the information needed to make discretionary\neconomic decisions. Nevertheless, a juror who failed to grasp\nthe subtlety of the explanation might easily believe that a\ndefendant could not be convicted of bank fraud unless his desire\nwas to injure the bank rather than to enrich himself, and\nthereby mistakenly acquit a defendant who clearly had an intent\nto harm in the broad sense defined by the panel, i.e.,\nfrustrating the bank's right to control the disposition of its\nassets.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fpromises.\"6 This language boils down to a prohibition on schemes\n\nto obtain money or other property from a bank by specified means\n\nof deception.     The particular means of deception chosen are not\n\nessential to the intent element, which can therefore be defined\n\nas an intent to deceive a bank in order to obtain from it money\n\nor   other   property.    Nothing   in   the   language   of   §   1344(2)\n\nindicates that \"intent to harm\" is required.\n\n             The statutory text does not fully dispose of the intent\n\nquestion, however, because the specific language of § 1344(2)\n\ncannot dictate the intent element of the general \"to defraud\"\n\nlanguage of § 1344(1).      On the face of the statute, § 1344(2)\n\nprovides an alternative to, not a definition of, a \"scheme or\n\nartifice to defraud\" in violation of § 1344(1).           Nothing in the\n\ntext of the statute requires that the intent element of §\n\n1344(1) be defined in the same way as the intent element of §\n\n1344(2) or, for that matter, that they be defined differently.\n\nMoreover, the Supreme Court said recently in Neder v. United\n\nStates, 527 U.S. 1, 20 (1999), that \"none of the fraud statutes\n\ndefines the phrase 'scheme or artifice to defraud.'\"           Yet Neder\n\n\n\n      6\n     As the Supreme Court explained in McNally, this language\nand the nearly identical language in the mail and wire fraud\nstatutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, dates to a 1909 amendment to\nthe mail fraud statute.      The prohibition of a \"scheme or\nartifice to defraud\" dates to the original 1872 enactment of the\nmail fraud statutes. See McNally, 483 U.S. at 356-59.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fprovides clear guidance on how to discern the elements of the\n\nscheme to defraud proscribed in § 1344(1).\n\n            The Neder Court addressed the question of whether\n\nmateriality is an element of a scheme to defraud under the mail,\n\nwire, and bank fraud statutes.               Because the statutes do not\n\ndefine the elements of a scheme to defraud, the Court followed\n\nthe    \"well-established       rule   of   construction\"    that    \"Congress\n\nintends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-\n\nlaw terms it uses.\"           Id. at 21, 23.         The use of the word\n\n\"defraud\"    raises    a   \"presumption      that   Congress    intended   to\n\nincorporate the common-law meaning of the term 'fraud' in the\n\nmail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes.\"                  Id. at 23\n\nn.7.    Since the statutory text does not rebut the presumption\n\nthat Congress intended to incorporate the common-law materiality\n\nelement, the Court held that \"materiality of falsehood is an\n\nelement of the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud\n\nstatutes.\"       Id. at 25.\n\n            Neder thus requires that we look to the common-law\n\nmeaning of fraud in examining the intent element of a \"scheme or\n\nartifice to defraud\" in violation of § 1344(1).                    The intent\n\nelement     of    common-law     civil     fraud    is   well   established.\n\nAccording to the Restatement, which the Neder Court relied on\n\nfor its definition of materiality, see 527 U.S. at 22 n.5\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f(quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 538 (1976)), \"One who\n\nfraudulently makes a misrepresentation . . . for the purpose of\n\ninducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance\n\nupon it, is subject to liability to the other in deceit . . . .\"\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 525 (1976); see also W. Page\n\nKeeton et al., Prosser & Keeton on the Law of Torts, § 105, at\n\n728 (5th ed. 1984) (\"[a]n intention to induce the plaintiff to\n\nact   or        refrain   from     action   in     reliance    upon   the\n\nmisrepresentation\" is an element of tort of deceit).           Commentary\n\nroughly contemporary with the Congress that enacted the mail\n\nfraud statute in 1872 gives a similar definition of the intent\n\nelement.        \"It is said that a man is liable to an action for\n\ndeceit if he makes a false representation to another, knowing it\n\nto be false, but intending that the other should believe and act\n\nupon it . . . .\"       Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 132\n\n(1881); see also 2 Charles G. Addison, A Treatise on the Law of\n\nTorts § 1174, at 398 (H.G. Wood ed., 1881) (\"[I]f a falsehood be\n\nknowingly told, with an intention that another person should\n\nbelieve it to be true, and act upon it, . . . the party telling\n\nthe falsehood is responsible in damages in an action for deceit\n\n. . . .\").\n\n            Common-law fraud thus requires an intent to induce\n\naction     by    the   plaintiff   in   reliance   on   the   defendant's\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fmisrepresentation. Commentators of the nineteenth and twentieth\n\ncenturies agree that common-law fraud has no additional \"intent\n\nto harm\" requirement.      See Prosser, supra, § 107, at 741 (it is\n\n\"well settled\" that \"intent to accomplish an ultimate purpose,\n\nas   to   benefit   the   speaker,    or    to   cause   harm   to   the   one\n\naddressed,\" is \"of no importance\" except to punitive damages);\n\n2 Addison, supra, § 1174, at 404 (\"[I]t is not necessary to\n\nprove that the false representation was made from a corrupt\n\nmotive of gain to the defendant, or a wicked motive of injury to\n\nthe plaintiff . . . .\").\n\n            The common-law element of intent to induce action by\n\nthe plaintiff in reliance on the defendant's misrepresentation\n\ntranslates directly into the criminal bank fraud context, where\n\na guilty defendant intends to induce the bank to act--i.e., to\n\npart with money or other property--in reliance on his deceit or\n\nmisrepresentation.7       Referring to an intent to induce reliance\n\nis potentially confusing to a jury, however, because it may\n\nerroneously suggest that actual reliance by the bank is also an\n\nelement of the crime, as it is an element of common-law civil\n\nfraud.    The Supreme Court has said that the common-law elements\n\n\n\n      7\n      The government proposes a similar formulation, stating in\nits supplemental brief that \"a person cannot commit [bank fraud]\nwithout at least intending that his fraudulent scheme cause the\nbank to part with money or other property.\"\n\n                                     -22-\n\fof justifiable reliance and damages \"plainly have no place in\n\nthe federal fraud statutes.\"      Neder, 527 U.S. at 25.     This\n\npotential for confusion is avoided by speaking simply of an\n\nintent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or\n\nother property.     We see no substantive difference between an\n\nintent to induce a bank to part with money in reliance on deceit\n\nor misrepresentation and an intent to deceive a bank in order to\n\nobtain from it money or other property.\n\n         The latter formulation is consistent with the text of\n\n§ 1344(2).   It is also similar to language we have used in\n\nseveral cases.    We have said, quoting an oft-cited Third Circuit\n\ncase, that a bank fraud scheme must be \"intended to deceive\n\nothers in order to obtain something of value, such as money,\n\nfrom the institution to be deceived.\"   United States v. Brandon,\n\n17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting       United States v.\n\nGoldblatt, 813 F.2d 619, 624 (3d Cir. 1987));8 accord United\n\nStates v. Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d 210, 221 (1st Cir. 1999); United\n\nStates v. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n    8 Several other circuits have also quoted with approval the\nsame language from Goldblatt, or its similar statement, 813 F.2d\nat 624, that \"[t]he bank fraud statute condemns schemes designed\nto deceive in order to obtain something of value.\" See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Dobbs, 63 F.3d 391, 395 (5th Cir. 1995); United\nStates v. Britton, 9 F.3d 708, 709 (8th Cir. 1993); United\nStates v. Hammen, 977 F.2d 379, 383 (7th Cir. 1992); United\nStates v. Cloud, 872 F.2d 846, 850 (9th Cir. 1989).\n\n                                -23-\n\fFurthermore, this formulation plainly comports with McNally's\n\nrequirement that a scheme to defraud be directed at \"wronging\n\none in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes.\"\n\n483 U.S. at 358.    We hold, therefore, that the intent element of\n\nbank fraud under either subsection is an intent to deceive the\n\nbank in order to obtain from it money or other property. 9\n\n\"Intent to harm\" is not required.\n\n          Applying our holding to the jury charge in this case,\n\nwe conclude that the instructions read as a whole, see United\n\nStates v. Robbio, 186 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 1999), adequately\n\nconveyed the essence of the intent element.          The district court\n\ntold the jurors that \"[t]he term 'defraud' means to deprive\n\nanother   of   something   of   value   by   means   of   deception   or\n\ncheating.\"     Given that instruction and the facts of this case,\n\nwe are confident that the jury could not have found Kenrick and\n\nOber guilty of bank fraud without finding that they intended to\n\ndeceive WCB in order to obtain money from it.             There was no\n\nplain error in the court's jury instructions.\n\n          We do not mean to imply, however, that the court's\n\ninstruction or the pattern bank fraud instruction on which it\n\nwas apparently based, see 1st Cir. Pattern Crim. Jury Instr.\n\n\n    9Of course, this element is not applicable in a case where\nthe alleged fraud is the deprivation of the bank's honest\nservices under 18 U.S.C. § 1346.\n\n                                 -24-\n\f4.14, is perfect.         Although it may \"ordinarily accompan[y]\" a\n\nscheme to defraud a bank, an ultimate \"purpose of either causing\n\nsome financial loss to another or bringing about some financial\n\ngain to oneself,\" id., is not the essence of fraudulent intent.\n\nWhat counts is whether the defendant intended to deceive the\n\nbank    in   order   to   obtain    from   it   money   or    other   property,\n\nregardless of the ultimate purpose.\n\n\n\n                     III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n             Both    defendants     challenge    the    sufficiency     of    the\n\nevidence     underlying     their    convictions.        In   reviewing      this\n\nchallenge, we ask \"whether, after viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of\n\nfact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\" Blasini, 169 F.3d at 62.\n\nA.     Count 5 (Bank Fraud)\n\n             Ober was convicted of bank fraud on Count 5 for his\n\ninvolvement in the 222 Stackpole Street transaction.                   Kenrick\n\nwas acquitted on the same count.                To convict a defendant of\n\nbank fraud, the government must prove that he \"(1) engaged in a\n\nscheme or artifice to defraud, or made false statements or\n\nmisrepresentations to obtain money from; (2) a . . . financial\n\ninstitution; and (3) did so knowingly.\"                 Brandon, 17 F.3d at\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\f424.    The scheme must involve material falsehood, see Neder, 525\n\nU.S. at 25, and the defendant must have acted with an intent to\n\ndefraud the bank, see Brandon, 17 F.3d at 425, which, as we have\n\nexplained, is an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain\n\nfrom it money or other property.\n\n            Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, there was ample evidence to convict Ober of bank\n\nfraud in connection with the 222 Stackpole Street transaction.10\n\nThe jury could have found that Ober was Flynn's partner in\n\npurchasing 222 Stackpole Street;11 that he concealed his interest\n\nby, inter alia, causing Flynn to submit a loan application to\n\nWCB that falsely listed her as sole owner; that WCB made a\n\n$900,000 loan to finance the purchase without approval of the\n\nBoard of Directors; and that someone falsified the Board minutes\n\n\n\n       10\n      In the midst of his argument that the evidence on Count 5\nwas insufficient, Ober contends that the district court erred in\nadmitting allegedly unreliable WCB documents. To the limited\nextent that his evidentiary arguments are developed enough to\npermit review, it is clear from our review of the record that\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\nchallenged evidence.    See United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d\n800, 812 n.11 (1st Cir. 1996).\n       11\n      Ober argues that if he had an interest in the Stackpole\nStreet property it was unenforceable under the statute of\nfrauds.   Even if he is correct, his significant financial\ninterest in the transaction was still a material fact that he\nhad a duty to disclose; its unenforceability does not preclude\nhis conviction. See United States v. Henderson, 19 F.3d 917,\n922-23 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                -26-\n\fto   make    it     appear   that    the   Board   had    approved    the    loan.\n\nConsidering Ober's interest in the transaction and his position\n\nas WCB president, the jury could infer that he caused the loan\n\nto be made and either altered the Board minutes himself or\n\ncaused them to be altered.\n\n              The    jury    could   further   have      concluded    that    Ober\n\nintended to deceive WCB in order to obtain the Stackpole Street\n\nloan.      Furthermore, although not necessary for conviction, as we\n\ndiscuss below in connection with Count 4, the jury could have\n\nfound--based on the size of the loan, the location of the\n\nproperty      outside    WCB's   usual     lending    area,   the    speculative\n\nnature of the condominium conversion, Flynn's lack of history of\n\nbusiness with WCB, and the fact that Ober's interest in the loan\n\nviolated Massachusetts banking law--that WCB would not have made\n\nthe loan if all the material facts had been revealed.                            A\n\nrational jury could have found Ober guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt on Count 5.12\n\n\n      12\n      We note that Ober's fraud was hardly novel.       We have\nupheld the bank fraud convictions of bank insiders for making\nloans in which they had undisclosed interests.       See United\nStates v. Mangone, 105 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 1997) (credit union\npresident);   United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223, 1226 (1st\nCir. 1995) (credit union founder and general counsel). Other\ncircuits have done the same.      See, e.g., United States v.\nHanson, 161 F.3d 896, 898 (5th Cir. 1998) (bank branch\npresident); United States v. Harvard, 103 F.3d 412, 421 (5th\nCir. 1997) (bank director); United States v. Henderson, 19 F.3d\n917, 922-23 (5th Cir. 1994) (bank owner/board chairman); United\n\n                                       -27-\n\fB.   Count 4 (Bank Fraud)\n\n          Ober and Kenrick were both found guilty of bank fraud\n\nin connection with the 8-10 Emerson Street transaction.      The\n\ngovernment's allegation as to this transaction was essentially\n\nthat it was a separate execution of the same scheme to defraud\n\nWCB charged in Count 5. 13   The government alleged that Kenrick\n\nand Ober entered into a secret agreement whereby Kenrick would\n\nsell 222 Stackpole Street to Ober and Flynn, giving Ober the\n\nopportunity to make a large profit by converting the property to\n\ncondominiums and Kenrick the chance to avoid the impending\n\nincrease in the capital gains tax; in exchange, Ober would make\n\nfinancing available through WCB to Chung Lee and her parents to\n\nbuy 8-10 Emerson Street, allowing Kenrick the same large tax\n\nadvantage on that sale.\n\n\n\n\nStates v. Rackley, 986 F.2d 1357, 1361 (10th Cir. 1993) (bank\npresident); United States v. Walker, 871 F.2d 1298, 1307 (6th\nCir. 1989) (bank president).\n     13\n      \"Under the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1344, each\nexecution of a scheme to defraud constitutes a separate\nindictable offense.\" Brandon, 17 F.3d at 422.\n\n                               -28-\n\f         The evidence, especially Chung Lee's testimony,14 was\n\nsufficient to allow the jury to find that there was such a\n\nsecret agreement.15   Like the Stackpole Street mortgage, then,\n\nthe Emerson Street mortgage was part of a scheme in which Ober\n\ndeceptively took WCB's funds, and placed WCB at risk of loss,\n\nfor his personal benefit.    There were differences between the\n\ntwo executions of the scheme, of course.    The benefit to Ober\n\nfrom Emerson Street was only indirect; he fraudulently obtained\n\nthe money in the form of a loan to the Lees, not to himself, and\n\nhe made no money from that transaction in isolation.   The jury\n\ncould have found, however, that he indirectly benefitted because\n\nthe Emerson Street loan made possible the Stackpole Street\n\npurchase from which Ober garnered a substantial profit.     The\n\n\n    14Kenrick argues on appeal that the jury could not\nrationally find the alleged agreement between him and Ober\nbecause Chung Lee's testimony was not credible. This argument\nis unavailing because \"[c]redibility assessments are properly\nleft to the jury.\" United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 60\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n    15A finding that this quid-pro-quo agreement existed is\nnecessary to sustain the convictions on Count 4 because, the\ngovernment's    arguments   to    the    contrary   on    appeal\nnotwithstanding, its existence is the one material fact that the\ndefendants allegedly concealed from WCB with respect to the\nEmerson Street transaction. The jury's verdict on Count 4 may\ntherefore be logically inconsistent with its verdict on Counts\n1, 2, and 3, finding both defendants not guilty of conspiracy\nand bank bribery. Inconsistency of this sort, however, does not\naffect our analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence on the\ncounts for which the defendants were convicted.      See United\nStates v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 67-69 (1984).\n\n                              -29-\n\fEmerson    Street     mortgage   was     approved     by    the    WCB    Board    of\n\nDirectors, but Ober never disclosed to them the existence of the\n\nsecret quid-pro-quo agreement.            Both loans benefitted Ober while\n\nexposing   WCB   to    potential     loss.      No    actual      pecuniary      loss\n\nresulted directly from the Stackpole Street loan, but the bank\n\nlost $119,645.84 when the Lees defaulted on the Emerson Street\n\nloan.\n\n           On appeal, Kenrick and Ober attempt to shift the focus\n\nfrom    their   nondisclosure      of    the   secret      agreement      onto    the\n\nfinancial status of the Lees.              They argue that the Lees were\n\ncreditworthy borrowers who would have been granted a loan in any\n\nevent, and that this fact precludes conviction on Count 4.                         At\n\nleast two circuits have held, however, that the creditworthiness\n\nof the borrower is no defense to bank fraud when there is\n\nconcealment of an insider interest in the transaction.                            See\n\nUnited States v. Doke, 171 F.3d 240, 245-46 (5th Cir. 1999);\n\nUnited States v.       Holley, 23 F.3d 902, 909 (5th Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Walker, 871 F.2d 1298, 1307 (6th Cir. 1989).\n\n           Moreover, the defendants' argument misses the point in\n\nan important way.       They mistake the character of the falsehood\n\nrequired for conviction by arguing, in effect, that it must have\n\nactually    induced     the   bank   to    make   a   loan     that      would    not\n\notherwise have been made.            On the contrary, to be criminally\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\ffraudulent a defendant's deceptive course of conduct must be\n\nmaterial, see Neder, 527 U.S. at 25, and it must be directed at\n\nobtaining money or other property from the bank, but there is no\n\nrequirement   that   it   actually   cause     the   bank   to    change      its\n\nbehavior, see id. at 24-25 (\"The common-law requirements of\n\n'justifiable reliance' and 'damages[]' . . . plainly have no\n\nplace in the federal fraud statutes.\").              A falsehood can be\n\nmaterial16 even if it did not in fact induce the bank to alter\n\nits   conduct,    although   if   such    alteration   did       occur   it    is\n\nobviously probative of materiality.            A misrepresentation about\n\na   borrower's    creditworthiness       can   certainly    be    a   material\n\nfalsehood that supports a bank fraud conviction, but a different\n\nfalsehood is also sufficient if it is material.\n\n\n\n\n      16According to the Supreme Court,\n\n      [A] matter is material if:\n\n      \"(a) a reasonable man would attach importance to its\n      existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of\n      action in the transaction in question; or\n\n      \"(b) the    maker of the representation knows or has\n      reason to   know that its recipient regards or is likely\n      to regard   the matter as important in determining his\n      choice of   action, although a reasonable man would not\n      so regard   it.\"\n\nNeder, 527 U.S. at 22 n.5 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§ 538 (1976)).\n\n                                   -31-\n\f          There was evidence that Kenrick and Ober had a secret\n\nquid-pro-quo agreement that gave Ober an indirect financial\n\ninterest in the Emerson Street loan, and that Kenrick applied\n\nfor the loan on the Lees' behalf and Ober approved it and\n\npresented it to the Board of Directors for ratification while\n\nconcealing the material fact of that agreement. On the basis of\n\nthat evidence, a rational jury could have found them both guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt on Count 4.17\n\nC.   Counts 18 and 20 (Bank Fraud)\n\n          Ober was found guilty of two counts of bank fraud in\n\nconnection with loans to the DGB Realty Trust, which Ober owned\n\nwith Glenn Gates and William Upton.   Count 18 concerned WCB's\n\n$15,000 demand loan to DGB, which was increased to $25,000 in\n\nDecember 1987, was never disclosed to or ratified by the Board\n\nof Directors, and was succeeded by a loan in the name of Upton\n\nthat had not been paid off at the time of trial.       Count 20\n\n\n     17The jury might have thought that Kenrick stood in a\nsomewhat different position from Ober.      Because he owed no\nfiduciary duty to WCB and had no power to cause it to make the\nloan, it could perhaps be argued that he did not himself execute\nthe scheme to defraud. The bank fraud charge against Kenrick,\nhowever, was alternatively premised on an aiding and abetting\ntheory. See 18 U.S.C. § 2. Even if Kenrick did not execute the\nscheme, there was sufficient evidence that he \"associated\nhimself with the venture, participated in it as something he\nwished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it\nsucceed,\" United States v. Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d 210, 223 (1st\nCir. 1999), to find him guilty of aiding and abetting Ober's\nfraud.\n\n                              -32-\n\fconcerned Ober's practice of having DGB checks paid, even though\n\nthere were insufficient funds in the DGB checking account, and\n\nheld for long periods until there was enough money in the\n\naccount to cover them--thus essentially providing Ober and his\n\npartners with undisclosed interest-free loans.                The indictment\n\nalleged, and the evidence showed, that one check in the amount\n\nof $6,780.42 was thus held for over nine months.                 The evidence\n\nwas    sufficient   to   find   Ober   guilty     on   both   counts.     Ober\n\nconcealed from the Board the plainly material fact that he was\n\nputting bank assets in his own pocket by means of undisclosed\n\nloans that put the bank at significant risk of loss and that\n\nwere eventually repaid either incompletely or without interest.\n\nIn short, the evidence on these counts, like the evidence on\n\nCounts 4 and 5, suggested that Ober treated WCB as his personal\n\npiggy bank, the assets of which he felt free to dispose of by\n\nloans to himself, his associates, or their designees.                   On that\n\nbasis a rational jury could have found Ober guilty of bank fraud\n\nas we have defined it above.\n\nD.     Count 22 (Perjury)\n\n            Ober was convicted of perjury for denying, under oath,\n\nthat he was familiar with the D & E Realty Trust and that he had\n\never    participated     in   making   a   loan    in    which    he    had   an\n\nundisclosed interest.         As recounted above, there was evidence\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fthat Ober was present when the D & E Realty Trust was executed,\n\nowned a half interest in it, and received half of its net\n\nincome.     There was also evidence that he participated in making\n\nundisclosed loans to the Riverview Development Trust and the DGB\n\nRealty Trust while having an interest in each trust.                   On the\n\nbasis of that evidence, the jury could have concluded that both\n\nof Ober's statements--which he stipulated were material--were\n\nfalse and that he made them willfully.                   See United States v.\n\nCardales, 168 F.3d 548, 558 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct.\n\n101 (1999) (elements of perjury are \"falsity, materiality, and\n\nwillfulness\").       Although Ober now argues that the question\n\nwhether he was \"familiar with\" the D & E Realty Trust was\n\nambiguous, there was sufficient evidence to prove that his\n\ndenial    was   false      on   any   reasonable    interpretation     of   the\n\nquestion.\n\n                     IV.    OBER'S DUE PROCESS CLAIMS\n\n            Ober raises two additional arguments, neither of which\n\nmerits extended discussion.                He contends first that he was\n\ndenied due process as a result of the government's alleged delay\n\nin   seeking    an   indictment       on    the   bank    fraud   charges   for\n\napproximately three years after its investigation was completed.\n\nTo succeed on such a claim, a defendant must demonstrate \"that\n\nthe preindictment delay caused him actual, substantial prejudice\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\f[and] that the prosecution orchestrated the delay to gain a\n\ntactical advantage over him.\"    United States v. Stokes, 124 F.3d\n\n39, 47 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing United States v. Marion, 404 U.S.\n\n307, 324 (1971)).    Ober can show neither; instead, he offers\n\nonly \"mere speculation and bare allegations,\" which are clearly\n\ninsufficient to make out a due process violation.    United States\n\nv. McCoy, 977 F.2d 706, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Ober also argues that the district court violated his\n\ndue process rights by preventing him from recross-examining an\n\nexpert witness, appraiser Calvin Hastings, called by Kenrick to\n\ntestify to the value of 222 Stackpole Street.     The court barred\n\nKenrick from conducting a redirect examination of Hastings as a\n\nsanction for Kenrick's failure--which was not discovered until\n\nthe   government's   cross-examination--to   disclose     Hastings's\n\nreport to the government.     The court permitted Ober's attorney,\n\nwho had already cross-examined Hastings, to begin recross, with\n\ninstructions that it be limited to the scope of the government's\n\ncross-examination.     When   Ober's   attorney   began   by   asking\n\nHastings whether he had expected he would be cross-examined on\n\nthe report, the court interrupted him, stopped the examination,\n\nand excused the witness.      Ober neither objected nor made an\n\noffer of proof.\n\n\n\n\n                                -35-\n\f            The   district     court    has     \"extensive       discretion\"     in\n\ncontrolling recross-examination.              United States v. Sorrentino,\n\n726 F.2d 876, 885 (1st Cir. 1984).              Here the court stopped the\n\nrecross because it concluded that Ober's attorney did not intend\n\nto   re-examine   Hastings     on   matters      within    the    scope    of   the\n\ngovernment's cross, but instead to conduct, in effect, the\n\nredirect that Kenrick's counsel could not.                This is exactly the\n\nsort   of    judgment   call    that      we    should     not    second-guess.\n\nConsidering that Ober had already had an opportunity to cross-\n\nexamine     Hastings,   the    court's        limitation    of    his     recross-\n\nexamination was not an abuse of its extensive discretion, let\n\nalone a due process violation.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -36-\n\f",

The jury found Kenrick guilty of one count of bank fraud and Ober guilty of four counts of bank fraud and one count of perjury. They argue, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the intent required for a bank fraud conviction. Although the panel that originally heard this case agreed with the defendants, it held that there was no plain error warranting reversal. See United States v. Kenrick, No. 98-1282, slip op. at 22, 33 (1st Cir. Feb. 22, 2000) (withdrawn). A majority of the circuit judges in active regular service ordered rehearing en banc and requested supplemental briefs on the intent issue. We now hold that, contrary to the defendants' argument and the earlier holding of the panel, \"intent to harm\" is not an element of bank fraud. We take this opportunity to clarify the nature of the intent element required for a bank fraud conviction. We also reject both defendants' challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, as well as sundry arguments raised by Ober. We therefore affirm the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. See United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 157 (1st Cir. 1999). In 1986, at the height of \"New England's late, lamented real estate boom,\" United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 302 (1st Cir. 1992), Derek Ober was the president of the Wakefield Cooperative Bank (\"WCB\" or \"the bank\") in Wakefield, Massachusetts. WCB is a state-chartered bank that has been insured by the FDIC since January 1986. Albert Kenrick, a real estate investor with substantial property in eastern Massachusetts, who had done business with WCB in the past, had an incentive to sell real estate in which he had large gains before January 1, 1987, because of a pending increase in capital gains taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. 222 Stackpole Street</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among Kenrick's properties was an eighteen-unit apartment building at 222 Stackpole Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. Kenrick discussed with Emily Flynn, a real estate broker whom he had dated in the past, the possibility of converting the building to condominiums and having Flynn sell them for him. Possibly contemplating the tax advantages of a sale before the end of 1986, however, Kenrick decided to sell the apartment building. Flynn had recently made a large profit on another condominium conversion, and she was interested in buying the Stackpole Street building with a partner. Although she wanted to have the same partner that she had had on her recent successful condo deal, Kenrick told her that Ober--whom Flynn had never met before--was interested in buying the property and that Kenrick preferred that Flynn and Ober purchase it as partners. On October 5, 1986, Flynn cooked a spaghetti dinner for Kenrick and Ober, and they negotiated a price for the Stackpole Street property of $935,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn asked Ober where they could get financing for the purchase, and he answered, \"Right here at this bank,\" i.e., WCB. Ober instructed Flynn that the loan application should be made in her name alone, even though they were equal partners, because he was going through a divorce. When she expressed doubt that she alone could qualify for such a large loan, he assured her that she could, and he filled out the application for her. Ober called John (Jay) Kimball, a lawyer who frequently represented WCB in mortgage transactions, and asked him to handle the paperwork for the Stackpole Street purchase. Kimball drafted the Riverview Development Trust, with Flynn as the trustee and only listed beneficiary, to hold title to the property. On Ober's instructions, Kimball also told Kenrick's attorney, who had drafted a purchase and sale agreement listing both Flynn and Ober as purchasers, that Flynn was to be listed as the only buyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An application for a $900,000 mortgage on the Stackpole Street property was filed with WCB. Pursuant to the standard procedure for mortgage applications at WCB, the applications went initially to Ober, who was both president and the bank's sole loan officer. The applications were then reviewed by two members of the Security Committee, a subcommittee of the Board of Directors, who set a value for the property, typically by visiting it themselves, without an outside appraisal. If approved by the Security Committee, loans would come before the Board of Directors at its monthly meeting for ratification. There was an unwritten policy that Board members should abstain from voting on loans in which they or their relatives had an interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober and another member of the Security Committee visited Stackpole Street, valued the property at $1,125,000, and recommended approval of the mortgage. The minutes of the Board of Directors meeting of November 26, 1986, indicate that the Board approved the Flynn loan. Three members of the Board, however, testified that the loan was never presented to them for a vote and that Ober never disclosed to them his interest in the property. An FBI document analyst testified that the entry in the Board minutes listing the loan was typed at a different time and with a different typewriter ball or wheel than the rest of the page.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The transaction closed on December 24, 1986. WCB provided a check for $900,000 and Flynn took title to the property as trustee of the Riverview Development Trust. Flynn herself provided the $50,000 down payment because Ober said he could not pay his half due to his pending divorce. The property was converted to condominiums, and seventeen of the eighteen units sold quickly, allowing Flynn to pay off the WCB loan in eight months. She shared the substantial profits equally with Ober, after repaying herself her contribution of his portion of the down payment. Ober assisted Flynn throughout the sales process, and managed to sell several units to friends and acquaintances, most of whom financed their purchases through WCB mortgages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The eighteenth unit was harder to sell. Title to that unit was transferred to another trust prepared by Attorney Kimball, the D &amp; E Realty Trust. Ober told Kimball that he had an interest in the unsold unit. Kimball therefore prepared two statements of beneficial interest for the trust, one listing Flynn as 100% beneficiary and the other listing Ober as 100% beneficiary; according to Flynn, they were equal partners in D &amp; E as in Riverview. Ober was present when the trust was executed. He received half the net income from D &amp; E and dealt with a condominium owner whose unit was damaged by flooding in the unit owned by D &amp; E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the beginning of the transaction, Ober took steps to conceal his interest in 222 Stackpole Street. He arranged that Flynn should take title from Kenrick in her name only, as trustee of the Riverview Development Trust, and that she should be listed as the sole borrower on the $900,000 loan from WCB to purchase the property. Ober had a motive to conceal his interest because, as the jury was told, a loan of that nature to a bank officer was forbidden by Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 170, &#167; 19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> When Flynn was deposed by the attorney for the former Mrs. Ober, Ober instructed her to perjure herself by stating that he had no interest in the Stackpole Street property, and she did so. Before Flynn was questioned by the FBI, Ober told her, \"I'll never admit to anything.\" Ober also denied his involvement in the Stackpole Street transaction at a 1991 WCB Board meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. 8-10 Emerson Street</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around the same time that he sold the Stackpole Street property, Kenrick sold a six-unit apartment building located at 8-10 Emerson Street in Wakefield to Chung Lee and her parents. The Lees were Korean immigrants who had formerly lived in a different building owned by Kenrick. They had purchased a two-family house on Willow Street in Melrose, Massachusetts, in 1983. Kenrick, who was dating Chung Lee, told her that he could teach her how to make a million dollars by investing in real estate. He suggested to her that she and her parents buy his Emerson Street building for $325,000. He advised financing the purchase with two loans from WCB: first, a $150,000 refinancing of the mortgage on the Willow Street property, which would provide money for the down payment, and then a $260,000 mortgage on 8-10 Emerson Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Chung Lee filled out an application for the Willow Street refinancing and filed it at WCB, it was not acted upon immediately. The original application was marked \"Hold\" in Ober's handwriting. After Kenrick met with Ober to negotiate the Stackpole Street sale, however, the refinancing was approved, with the commitment letter dated October 22, 1986. Kenrick himself filled out the application for the Lees' Emerson Street mortgage, and his appointment calendar indicated that he gave it to Ober personally on November 3, 1986. The Board of Directors ratified the Willow Street loan on November 26 and the Emerson Street loan on December 18. The sale of 8-10 Emerson Street closed on December 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As alleged by the government, there was evidence of a quid-pro-quo agreement between Kenrick and Ober that Kenrick would sell 222 Stackpole Street to Flynn and Ober and, in exchange, Ober would provide financing through the bank to allow Kenrick to sell 8-10 Emerson Street to the Lees. Following his spaghetti dinner meeting with Flynn and Ober on October 5, 1986, where they negotiated the Stackpole Street deal, Kenrick made a note that \"I agreed at 935,000 to keep good rapport with Derek and thought with his financing ability &amp; Emily's condo sales experience we could all be happy.\" In Kenrick's 1986 appointment calendar, otherwise filled with detailed notes for most days of the year, the page for October 4-6 is missing. Within three weeks of the October 5 meeting the loan to refinance the Lee family's property on Willow Street in Melrose, submitted to WCB in August and marked \"Hold\" in Ober's handwriting, had been approved; within two more weeks, the application for the $260,000 mortgage for the Lees to purchase 8-10 Emerson Street had been completed by Kenrick and delivered by him to Ober.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the agreement between Ober and Kenrick was testified to by Chung Lee. She testified that Kenrick told her, in explaining why he sold 222 Stackpole Street to Flynn and Ober, that \"Mr. Ober can lend me the money because he's the Bank President. So, you know, that will work out very well.\" When asked what the relationship was between the Stackpole Street deal and Kenrick's sale of other properties, including 8-10 Emerson Street, she answered first, \"Well, because if Bert [Kenrick] helps Derek Ober, Derek Ober can help Bert to sell other properties.\" When asked again what Kenrick had said about the relationship between the different deals, she answered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Bert sold it to Derek, Stackpole Street, that's why he can sell his Tuttle Street commercial properties. And 8-10 Emerson Street, he can sell. And he can also sell Methuen property at 175 Haverhill Street, for I think, a million dollars or $900,000. I cannot remember. But he can sell that because Bert help Derek Ober to make money. That way, you know, he can help Bert later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chung Lee married Kenrick in October 1988 and was still married to him at the time of trial in October 1997, although divorce proceedings were then pending. She and her parents continued to own the Emerson Street property, but had to obtain an additional loan from WCB to cover cash flow problems. Eventually, after the tenants were forced to move out when Chung Lee (now Chung Kenrick) contaminated the building in attempting to remove lead paint, she defaulted on the mortgage and filed for bankruptcy. The bank wrote off a loss of $119,645.84 on the Emerson Street mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. DGB Realty Trust</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1985, Ober formed the DGB Realty Trust with WCB Treasurer Glenn Gates and William Upton, a retired local police officer. DGB bought three condominium units in Hudson, Massachusetts, and financed the purchases through Greater Boston Bank. DGB lost money from the start, and its checking account at WCB soon contained insufficient money to pay the trust's bills. To cover the shortfall, Ober decided to issue a demand loan from WCB to DGB for $15,000 on December 4, 1986. On December 11, 1987, the amount of the demand loan was increased to $25,000. Although there was testimony that some bank employees, and possibly some members of the Board of Directors, knew of the interest of Ober and Gates in DGB, three directors testified that Ober did not disclose the demand loan to the Board. In January 1988, the DGB demand loan was paid off with the proceeds of a new demand loan in the name of William Upton. Although the new loan was in Upton's name alone, Ober and Gates were still each responsible for one-third of the debt. Ober and Upton paid off their shares, but Gates still owed money on his at the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The demand loans did not turn DGB into a profitable venture, and on multiple occasions checks were written on DGB's account at WCB although there were insufficient funds to cover them. At that time WCB did not offer its customers overdraft protection or lines of credit. If a check was presented for payment with insufficient funds in the account, customers were typically allowed to make it good by depositing funds on the same day the check was presented; if they could not, the check bounced. Apparently checks were sometimes held for longer periods for bank employees or Board members. On Ober's instructions, however, DGB checks were held for unprecedented lengths of time, after the checks were paid and without sufficient funds in DGB's account to cover them. Fourteen checks, totaling over $36,000, were held for a total of 576 days; no checks bounced, and DGB payed no interest or fees. The last of these was the largest: check number 182, in the amount of $6,780.42, was presented for payment, and paid, on March 17, 1988, but there were insufficient funds in the DGB account to cover it until January 6, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Ober Deposition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The WCB Board of Directors fired Ober and Gates amid allegations of misconduct in 1991. In 1993, WCB brought an action against North American Specialty Insurance Company to recover on a fidelity bond for losses to the bank allegedly caused by the fraudulent conduct of Ober, Gates, and Attorney Kimball. The suit was brought in Massachusetts Superior Court and removed by the defendant to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. As a part of discovery in that action, Ober, then living in Florida, was deposed under oath on March 10 and 11, 1994. Ober was asked, \"Now, Mr. Kimball drew a realty trust entitled D, ampersand, E Realty Trust, D &amp; E Realty Trust. Are you familiar with that?\" He answered, \"No.\" Ober was also asked, \"Did you ever participate in the making of a loan where you had an undisclosed interest?\" He again answered, \"No.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury issued a twenty-two count indictment against Kenrick and Ober on December 18, 1996. The indictment charged Kenrick with conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, bank bribery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 215(a), and three counts of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. It charged Ober with conspiracy, bank bribery, seventeen counts of bank fraud, and two counts of perjury, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623. The case was tried to a jury from September 15 to October 27, 1997. The jury found Kenrick guilty on one count of bank fraud and Ober guilty on four counts of bank fraud and one count of perjury. They were acquitted on all other counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON BANK FRAUD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kenrick and Ober argue that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that they could not be convicted of bank fraud unless they intended to harm WCB.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Because they failed to raise this objection before the district court, we review for plain error. See United States v. Robbio, 186 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 1999); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) to defraud a financial institution; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be [subject to a specified maximum fine and term of imprisonment].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants object to a portion of the district court's instruction defining a \"scheme to defraud\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A scheme to defraud is ordinarily accompanied by a desire or a purpose to bring about some gain or benefit to one's self [sic] or some other person or by a desire or purpose to cause some loss to some other person. Here, there is not alleged--effectively, there hasn't been any evidence offered--that there was an intent to cause a loss to some other person. Here, we're dealing with allegations that there was to be some benefit to Mr. Ober, to Mr. Kenrick, or to people that Mr. Kenrick was concerned about.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also separately defined \"intent to defraud\": \"To act with intent to defraud means to act wilfully with a specific intent to deceive or cheat or for the purpose of either causing some financial gain to another or one's self [sic].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel that first considered this case agreed with the defendants that intent to defraud necessarily includes an \"intent to harm\" the bank, and that the district court erred by omitting this requirement from its jury instructions. The panel further held that there was no plain error. After further consideration of the intent issue, the en banc court, including the panel members, arrives at a different conclusion about the meaning of intent to defraud. We now hold, for the reasons set forth below, that the intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction is an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel addressed the intent question in the terms that the defendants posed it--whether evidence of an intent to deceive a bank and to enrich oneself or another person would support a bank fraud conviction without evidence of an intent to harm the bank. The panel's answer that proof of intent to harm was required was based on precedents from other circuits and an interpretation of the opinion of the Supreme Court in McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), a case in which the Supreme Court held that the mail fraud statute does not reach \"honest services\" fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> By its terms, however, McNally does not require proof of \"intent to harm\" as an element of bank fraud, and there are no Supreme Court precedents that define the intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction. There is also no consensus among the circuits on the issue. Moreover, the \"intent to harm\" formulation of the panel contained an ambiguity that could not be dispelled easily.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arriving at our formulation of the intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction, we begin with the language of the bank fraud statute. Because neither the indictment nor the jury instructions specified the subsection of &#167; 1344 under which Kenrick and Ober were charged, we must examine both subsections. Section 1344(2) specifies an intent requirement. It prescribes a punishment for \"whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice... to obtain any of the monies, funds, credits, assets, securities or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> This language boils down to a prohibition on schemes to obtain money or other property from a bank by specified means of deception. The particular means of deception chosen are not essential to the intent element, which can therefore be defined as an intent to deceive a bank in order to obtain from it money or other property. Nothing in the language of &#167; 1344(2) indicates that \"intent to harm\" is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory text does not fully dispose of the intent question, however, because the specific language of &#167; 1344(2) cannot dictate the intent element of the general \"to defraud\" language of &#167; 1344(1). On the face of the statute, &#167; 1344(2) provides an alternative to, not a definition of, a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" in violation of &#167; 1344(1). Nothing in the text of the statute requires that the intent element of &#167; 1344(1) be defined in the same way as the intent element of &#167; 1344(2) or, for that matter, that they be defined differently.Moreover, the Supreme Court said recently in Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 20 (1999), that \"none of the fraud statutes defines the phrase'scheme or artifice to defraud.'\" Yet Neder provides clear guidance on how to discern the elements of the scheme to defraud proscribed in &#167; 1344(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Neder Court addressed the question of whether materiality is an element of a scheme to defraud under the mail, wire, and bank fraud statutes. Because the statutes do not define the elements of a scheme to defraud, the Court followed the \"well-established rule of construction\" that \"Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\" Id. at 21, 23. The use of the word \"defraud\" raises a \"presumption that Congress intended to incorporate the common-law meaning of the term 'fraud' in the mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes.\" Id. at 23 n.7. Since the statutory text does not rebut the presumption that Congress intended to incorporate the common-law materiality element, the Court held that \"materiality of falsehood is an element of the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes.\" Id. at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neder thus requires that we look to the common-law meaning of fraud in examining the intent element of a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" in violation of &#167; 1344(1). The intent element of common-law civil fraud is well established. According to the Restatement, which the Neder Court relied on for its definition of materiality, see 527 U.S. at 22 n.5 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 538 (1976)), \"One who fraudulently makes a misrepresentation... for the purpose of inducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon it, is subject to liability to the other in deceit....\" Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 525 (1976); see also W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts, &#167; 105, at 728 (5th ed. 1984) (\"[a]n intention to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from action in reliance upon the misrepresentation\" is an element of tort of deceit). Commentary roughly contemporary with the Congress that enacted the mail fraud statute in 1872 gives a similar definition of the intent element. \"It is said that a man is liable to an action for deceit if he makes a false representation to another, knowing it to be false, but intending that the other should believe and act upon it....\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 132 (1881); see also 2 Charles G. Addison, A Treatise on the Law of Torts &#167; 1174, at 398 (H.G. Wood ed., 1881) (\"[I]f a falsehood be knowingly told, with an intention that another person should believe it to be true, and act upon it,... the party telling the falsehood is responsible in damages in an action for deceit....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Common-law fraud thus requires an intent to induce action by the plaintiff in reliance on the defendant's misrepresentation. Commentators of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries agree that common-law fraud has no additional \"intent to harm\" requirement. See Prosser, supra, &#167; 107, at 741 (it is \"well settled\" that \"intent to accomplish an ultimate purpose, as to benefit the speaker, or to cause harm to the one addressed,\" is \"of no importance\" except to punitive damages); 2 Addison, supra, &#167; 1174, at 404 (\"[I]t is not necessary to prove that the false representation was made from a corrupt motive of gain to the defendant, or a wicked motive of injury to the plaintiff....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common-law element of intent to induce action by the plaintiff in reliance on the defendant's misrepresentation translates directly into the criminal bank fraud context, where a guilty defendant intends to induce the bank to act--i.e., to part with money or other property--in reliance on his deceit or misrepresentation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Referring to an intent to induce reliance is potentially confusing to a jury, however, because it may erroneously suggest that actual reliance by the bank is also an element of the crime, as it is an element of common-law civil fraud. The Supreme Court has said that the common-law elements of justifiable reliance and damages \"plainly have no place in the federal fraud statutes.\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 25. This potential for confusion is avoided by speaking simply of an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property. We see no substantive difference between an intent to induce a bank to part with money in reliance on deceit or misrepresentation and an intent to deceive a bank in order to obtain from it money or other property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter formulation is consistent with the text of &#167; 1344(2). It is also similar to language we have used in several cases. We have said, quoting an oft-cited Third Circuit case, that a bank fraud scheme must be \"intended to deceive others in order to obtain something of value, such as money, from the institution to be deceived.\" United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Goldblatt, 813 F.2d 619, 624 (3d Cir. 1987));<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> accord United States v. Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d 210, 221 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir. 1999). Furthermore, this formulation plainly comports with McNally's requirement that a scheme to defraud be directed at \"wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes.\" 483 U.S. at 358. We hold, therefore, that the intent element of bank fraud under either subsection is an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> \"Intent to harm\" is not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying our holding to the jury charge in this case, we conclude that the instructions read as a whole, see United States v. Robbio, 186 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 1999), adequately conveyed the essence of the intent element. The district court told the jurors that \"[t]he term 'defraud' means to deprive another of something of value by means of deception or cheating.\" Given that instruction and the facts of this case, we are confident that the jury could not have found Kenrick and Ober guilty of bank fraud without finding that they intended to deceive WCB in order to obtain money from it. There was no plain error in the court's jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to imply, however, that the court's instruction or the pattern bank fraud instruction on which it was apparently based, see 1st Cir. Pattern Crim. Jury Instr. 4.14, is perfect. Although it may \"ordinarily accompan[y]\" a scheme to defraud a bank, an ultimate \"purpose of either causing some financial loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to oneself,\" id., is not the essence of fraudulent intent. What counts is whether the defendant intended to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property, regardless of the ultimate purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their convictions. In reviewing this challenge, we ask \"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Blasini, 169 F.3d at 62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Count 5 (Bank Fraud)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober was convicted of bank fraud on Count 5 for his involvement in the 222 Stackpole Street transaction. Kenrick was acquitted on the same count. To convict a defendant of bank fraud, the government must prove that he \"(1) engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud, or made false statements or misrepresentations to obtain money from; (2) a... financial institution; and (3) did so knowingly.\" Brandon, 17 F.3d at 424. The scheme must involve material falsehood, see Neder, 525 U.S. at 25, and the defendant must have acted with an intent to defraud the bank, see Brandon, 17 F.3d at 425, which, as we have explained, is an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the government, there was ample evidence to convict Ober of bank fraud in connection with the 222 Stackpole Street transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The jury could have found that Ober was Flynn's partner in purchasing 222 Stackpole Street;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> that he concealed his interest by, inter alia, causing Flynn to submit a loan application to WCB that falsely listed her as sole owner; that WCB made a $900,000 loan to finance the purchase without approval of the Board of Directors; and that someone falsified the Board minutes to make it appear that the Board had approved the loan. Considering Ober's interest in the transaction and his position as WCB president, the jury could infer that he caused the loan to be made and either altered the Board minutes himself or caused them to be altered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could further have concluded that Ober intended to deceive WCB in order to obtain the Stackpole Street loan. Furthermore, although not necessary for conviction, as we discuss below in connection with Count 4, the jury could have found--based on the size of the loan, the location of the property outside WCB's usual lending area, the speculative nature of the condominium conversion, Flynn's lack of history of business with WCB, and the fact that Ober's interest in the loan violated Massachusetts banking law--that WCB would not have made the loan if all the material facts had been revealed. A rational jury could have found Ober guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on Count 5.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Count 4 (Bank Fraud)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober and Kenrick were both found guilty of bank fraud in connection with the 8-10 Emerson Street transaction. The government's allegation as to this transaction was essentially that it was a separate execution of the same scheme to defraud WCB charged in Count 5.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The government alleged that Kenrick and Ober entered into a secret agreement whereby Kenrick would sell 222 Stackpole Street to Ober and Flynn, giving Ober the opportunity to make a large profit by converting the property to condominiums and Kenrick the chance to avoid the impending increase in the capital gains tax; in exchange, Ober would make financing available through WCB to Chung Lee and her parents to buy 8-10 Emerson Street, allowing Kenrick the same large tax advantage on that sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, especially Chung Lee's testimony,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> was sufficient to allow the jury to find that there was such a secret agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Like the Stackpole Street mortgage, then, the Emerson Street mortgage was part of a scheme in which Ober deceptively took WCB's funds, and placed WCB at risk of loss, for his personal benefit. There were differences between the two executions of the scheme, of course. The benefit to Ober from Emerson Street was only indirect; he fraudulently obtained the money in the form of a loan to the Lees, not to himself, and he made no money from that transaction in isolation. The jury could have found, however, that he indirectly benefitted because the Emerson Street loan made possible the Stackpole Street purchase from which Ober garnered a substantial profit. The Emerson Street mortgage was approved by the WCB Board of Directors, but Ober never disclosed to them the existence of the secret quid-pro-quo agreement. Both loans benefitted Ober while exposing WCB to potential loss. No actual pecuniary loss resulted directly from the Stackpole Street loan, but the bank lost $119,645.84 when the Lees defaulted on the Emerson Street loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Kenrick and Ober attempt to shift the focus from their nondisclosure of the secret agreement onto the financial status of the Lees. They argue that the Lees were creditworthy borrowers who would have been granted a loan in any event, and that this fact precludes conviction on Count 4. At least two circuits have held, however, that the creditworthiness of the borrower is no defense to bank fraud when there is concealment of an insider interest in the transaction. See United States v. Doke, 171 F.3d 240, 245-46 (5th Cir. 1999); United States v. Holley, 23 F.3d 902, 909 (5th Cir. 1994); United States v. Walker, 871 F.2d 1298, 1307 (6th Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the defendants' argument misses the point in an important way. They mistake the character of the falsehood required for conviction by arguing, in effect, that it must have actually induced the bank to make a loan that would not otherwise have been made. On the contrary, to be criminally fraudulent a defendant's deceptive course of conduct must be material, see Neder, 527 U.S. at 25, and it must be directed at obtaining money or other property from the bank, but there is no requirement that it actually cause the bank to change its behavior, see id. at 24-25 (\"The common-law requirements of 'justifiable reliance' and 'damages[]'... plainly have no place in the federal fraud statutes.\"). A falsehood can be material<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> even if it did not in fact induce the bank to alter its conduct, although if such alteration did occur it is obviously probative of materiality. A misrepresentation about a borrower's creditworthiness can certainly be a material falsehood that supports a bank fraud conviction, but a different falsehood is also sufficient if it is material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence that Kenrick and Ober had a secret quid-pro-quo agreement that gave Ober an indirect financial interest in the Emerson Street loan, and that Kenrick applied for the loan on the Lees' behalf and Ober approved it and presented it to the Board of Directors for ratification while concealing the material fact of that agreement. On the basis of that evidence, a rational jury could have found them both guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on Count 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Counts 18 and 20 (Bank Fraud)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober was found guilty of two counts of bank fraud in connection with loans to the DGB Realty Trust, which Ober owned with Glenn Gates and William Upton. Count 18 concerned WCB's $15,000 demand loan to DGB, which was increased to $25,000 in December 1987, was never disclosed to or ratified by the Board of Directors, and was succeeded by a loan in the name of Upton that had not been paid off at the time of trial. Count 20 concerned Ober's practice of having DGB checks paid, even though there were insufficient funds in the DGB checking account, and held for long periods until there was enough money in the account to cover them--thus essentially providing Ober and his partners with undisclosed interest-free loans. The indictment alleged, and the evidence showed, that one check in the amount of $6,780.42 was thus held for over nine months. The evidence was sufficient to find Ober guilty on both counts. Ober concealed from the Board the plainly material fact that he was putting bank assets in his own pocket by means of undisclosed loans that put the bank at significant risk of loss and that were eventually repaid either incompletely or without interest. In short, the evidence on these counts, like the evidence on Counts 4 and 5, suggested that Ober treated WCB as his personal piggy bank, the assets of which he felt free to dispose of by loans to himself, his associates, or their designees. On that basis a rational jury could have found Ober guilty of bank fraud as we have defined it above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Count 22 (Perjury)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober was convicted of perjury for denying, under oath, that he was familiar with the D &amp; E Realty Trust and that he had ever participated in making a loan in which he had an undisclosed interest. As recounted above, there was evidence that Ober was present when the D &amp; E Realty Trust was executed, owned a half interest in it, and received half of its net income. There was also evidence that he participated in making undisclosed loans to the Riverview Development Trust and the DGB Realty Trust while having an interest in each trust. On the basis of that evidence, the jury could have concluded that both of Ober's statements--which he stipulated were material--were false and that he made them willfully. See United States v. Cardales, 168 F.3d 548, 558 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 101 (1999) (elements of perjury are \"falsity, materiality, and willfulness\"). Although Ober now argues that the question whether he was \"familiar with\" the D &amp; E Realty Trust was ambiguous, there was sufficient evidence to prove that his denial was false on any reasonable interpretation of the question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. OBER'S DUE PROCESS CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober raises two additional arguments, neither of which merits extended discussion. He contends first that he was denied due process as a result of the government's alleged delay in seeking an indictment on the bank fraud charges for approximately three years after its investigation was completed. To succeed on such a claim, a defendant must demonstrate \"that the preindictment delay caused him actual, substantial prejudice [and] that the prosecution orchestrated the delay to gain a tactical advantage over him.\" United States v. Stokes, 124 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 324 (1971)). Ober can show neither; instead, he offers only \"mere speculation and bare allegations,\" which are clearly insufficient to make out a due process violation. United States v. McCoy, 977 F.2d 706, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober also argues that the district court violated his due process rights by preventing him from recross-examining an expert witness, appraiser Calvin Hastings, called by Kenrick to testify to the value of 222 Stackpole Street. The court barred Kenrick from conducting a redirect examination of Hastings as a sanction for Kenrick's failure--which was not discovered until the government's cross-examination--to disclose Hastings's report to the government. The court permitted Ober's attorney, who had already cross-examined Hastings, to begin recross, with instructions that it be limited to the scope of the government's cross-examination. When Ober's attorney began by asking Hastings whether he had expected he would be cross-examined on the report, the court interrupted him, stopped the examination, and excused the witness. Ober neither objected nor made an offer of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has \"extensive discretion\" in controlling recross-examination. United States v. Sorrentino, 726 F.2d 876, 885 (1st Cir. 1984). Here the court stopped the recross because it concluded that Ober's attorney did not intend to re-examine Hastings on matters within the scope of the government's cross, but instead to conduct, in effect, the redirect that Kenrick's counsel could not. This is exactly the sort of judgment call that we should not second-guess. Considering that Ober had already had an opportunity to cross-examine Hastings, the court's limitation of his recross-examination was not an abuse of its extensive discretion, let alone a due process violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The jury was also told that the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O required a bank officer to disclose his interest in a loan to the bank's board of directors and to abstain from voting on the loan. See 12 C.F.R. pt. 215.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  This argument was raised more clearly before the panel by Kenrick than by Ober, but Ober has joined in it in his supplemental brief before the en banc court. To the extent that Ober also makes a separate argument that the court erred by not requiring proof that the bank in fact lost money as a result of his conduct, he is clearly incorrect: section 1344 by its terms punishes not merely successful frauds, but any execution or attempted execution of a scheme to defraud a bank. See Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1999) (noting that common-law element of damages \"plainly ha[s] no place in the federal fraud statutes\"); United States v. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"The government need not prove actual loss as a result of the scheme....\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  For the sake of convenience we will refer to this current version of &#167; 1344, although the defendants were convicted under a previous version that was different in some ways not relevant here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  In 1988 Congress overturned the holding of McNally by enacting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346, which defines \"'scheme or artifice to defraud' [to] include[] a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\" Section 1346 is inapplicable here because the allegedly fraudulent acts in this case took place before its effective date.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  In common usage, \"intent to harm\" may well be understood to mean a motive to cause the bank an ultimate financial loss. Of course, a court could explain to a jury that intent to harm had nothing to do with a motive to hurt a bank, and could explain further that the panel's broad definition of \"intent to harm\" included depriving a bank of the right to control its assets by depriving it of the information needed to make discretionary economic decisions. Nevertheless, a juror who failed to grasp the subtlety of the explanation might easily believe that a defendant could not be convicted of bank fraud unless his desire was to injure the bank rather than to enrich himself, and thereby mistakenly acquit a defendant who clearly had an intent to harm in the broad sense defined by the panel, i.e., frustrating the bank's right to control the disposition of its assets.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  As the Supreme Court explained in McNally, this language and the nearly identical language in the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1343, dates to a 1909 amendment to the mail fraud statute.

The jury's verdict on Count 4 may therefore be logically inconsistent with its verdict on Counts 1, 2, and 3, finding both defendants not guilty of conspiracy and bank bribery. Inconsistency of this sort, however, does not affect our analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence on the counts for which the defendants were convicted. See United States v.

The jury found Kenrick guilty of one count of bank fraud and Ober guilty of four counts of bank fraud and one count of perjury. They argue, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the intent required for a bank fraud conviction. Although the panel that originally heard this case agreed with the defendants, it held that there was no plain error warranting reversal. See United States v. Kenrick, No. 98-1282, slip op. at 22, 33 (1st Cir. Feb. 22, 2000) (withdrawn). A majority of the circuit judges in active regular service ordered rehearing en banc and requested supplemental briefs on the intent issue. We now hold that, contrary to the defendants' argument and the earlier holding of the panel, \"intent to harm\" is not an element of bank fraud. We take this opportunity to clarify the nature of the intent element required for a bank fraud conviction. We also reject both defendants' challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, as well as sundry arguments raised by Ober. We therefore affirm the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. See United States v.

In 1986, at the height of \"New England's late, lamented real estate boom,\" United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 302 (1st Cir. 1992), Derek Ober was the president of the Wakefield Cooperative Bank (\"WCB\" or \"the bank\") in Wakefield, Massachusetts. WCB is a state-chartered bank that has been insured by the FDIC since January 1986. Albert Kenrick, a real estate investor with substantial property in eastern Massachusetts, who had done business with WCB in the past, had an incentive to sell real estate in which he had large gains before January 1, 1987, because of a pending increase in capital gains taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. 222 Stackpole Street</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among Kenrick's properties was an eighteen-unit apartment building at 222 Stackpole Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. Kenrick discussed with Emily Flynn, a real estate broker whom he had dated in the past, the possibility of converting the building to condominiums and having Flynn sell them for him. Possibly contemplating the tax advantages of a sale before the end of 1986, however, Kenrick decided to sell the apartment building. Flynn had recently made a large profit on another condominium conversion, and she was interested in buying the Stackpole Street building with a partner. Although she wanted to have the same partner that she had had on her recent successful condo deal, Kenrick told her that Ober--whom Flynn had never met before--was interested in buying the property and that Kenrick preferred that Flynn and Ober purchase it as partners. On October 5, 1986, Flynn cooked a spaghetti dinner for Kenrick and Ober, and they negotiated a price for the Stackpole Street property of $935,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn asked Ober where they could get financing for the purchase, and he answered, \"Right here at this bank,\" i.e., WCB. Ober instructed Flynn that the loan application should be made in her name alone, even though they were equal partners, because he was going through a divorce. When she expressed doubt that she alone could qualify for such a large loan, he assured her that she could, and he filled out the application for her. Ober called John (Jay) Kimball, a lawyer who frequently represented WCB in mortgage transactions, and asked him to handle the paperwork for the Stackpole Street purchase. Kimball drafted the Riverview Development Trust, with Flynn as the trustee and only listed beneficiary, to hold title to the property. On Ober's instructions, Kimball also told Kenrick's attorney, who had drafted a purchase and sale agreement listing both Flynn and Ober as purchasers, that Flynn was to be listed as the only buyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An application for a $900,000 mortgage on the Stackpole Street property was filed with WCB. Pursuant to the standard procedure for mortgage applications at WCB, the applications went initially to Ober, who was both president and the bank's sole loan officer. The applications were then reviewed by two members of the Security Committee, a subcommittee of the Board of Directors, who set a value for the property, typically by visiting it themselves, without an outside appraisal. If approved by the Security Committee, loans would come before the Board of Directors at its monthly meeting for ratification. There was an unwritten policy that Board members should abstain from voting on loans in which they or their relatives had an interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober and another member of the Security Committee visited Stackpole Street, valued the property at $1,125,000, and recommended approval of the mortgage. The minutes of the Board of Directors meeting of November 26, 1986, indicate that the Board approved the Flynn loan. Three members of the Board, however, testified that the loan was never presented to them for a vote and that Ober never disclosed to them his interest in the property. An FBI document analyst testified that the entry in the Board minutes listing the loan was typed at a different time and with a different typewriter ball or wheel than the rest of the page.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The transaction closed on December 24, 1986. WCB provided a check for $900,000 and Flynn took title to the property as trustee of the Riverview Development Trust. Flynn herself provided the $50,000 down payment because Ober said he could not pay his half due to his pending divorce. The property was converted to condominiums, and seventeen of the eighteen units sold quickly, allowing Flynn to pay off the WCB loan in eight months. She shared the substantial profits equally with Ober, after repaying herself her contribution of his portion of the down payment. Ober assisted Flynn throughout the sales process, and managed to sell several units to friends and acquaintances, most of whom financed their purchases through WCB mortgages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The eighteenth unit was harder to sell. Title to that unit was transferred to another trust prepared by Attorney Kimball, the D &amp; E Realty Trust. Ober told Kimball that he had an interest in the unsold unit. Kimball therefore prepared two statements of beneficial interest for the trust, one listing Flynn as 100% beneficiary and the other listing Ober as 100% beneficiary; according to Flynn, they were equal partners in D &amp; E as in Riverview. Ober was present when the trust was executed. He received half the net income from D &amp; E and dealt with a condominium owner whose unit was damaged by flooding in the unit owned by D &amp; E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the beginning of the transaction, Ober took steps to conceal his interest in 222 Stackpole Street. He arranged that Flynn should take title from Kenrick in her name only, as trustee of the Riverview Development Trust, and that she should be listed as the sole borrower on the $900,000 loan from WCB to purchase the property. Ober had a motive to conceal his interest because, as the jury was told, a loan of that nature to a bank officer was forbidden by Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 170, &#167; 19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> When Flynn was deposed by the attorney for the former Mrs. Ober, Ober instructed her to perjure herself by stating that he had no interest in the Stackpole Street property, and she did so. Before Flynn was questioned by the FBI, Ober told her, \"I'll never admit to anything.\" Ober also denied his involvement in the Stackpole Street transaction at a 1991 WCB Board meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. 8-10 Emerson Street</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around the same time that he sold the Stackpole Street property, Kenrick sold a six-unit apartment building located at 8-10 Emerson Street in Wakefield to Chung Lee and her parents. The Lees were Korean immigrants who had formerly lived in a different building owned by Kenrick. They had purchased a two-family house on Willow Street in Melrose, Massachusetts, in 1983. Kenrick, who was dating Chung Lee, told her that he could teach her how to make a million dollars by investing in real estate. He suggested to her that she and her parents buy his Emerson Street building for $325,000. He advised financing the purchase with two loans from WCB: first, a $150,000 refinancing of the mortgage on the Willow Street property, which would provide money for the down payment, and then a $260,000 mortgage on 8-10 Emerson Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Chung Lee filled out an application for the Willow Street refinancing and filed it at WCB, it was not acted upon immediately. The original application was marked \"Hold\" in Ober's handwriting. After Kenrick met with Ober to negotiate the Stackpole Street sale, however, the refinancing was approved, with the commitment letter dated October 22, 1986. Kenrick himself filled out the application for the Lees' Emerson Street mortgage, and his appointment calendar indicated that he gave it to Ober personally on November 3, 1986. The Board of Directors ratified the Willow Street loan on November 26 and the Emerson Street loan on December 18. The sale of 8-10 Emerson Street closed on December 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As alleged by the government, there was evidence of a quid-pro-quo agreement between Kenrick and Ober that Kenrick would sell 222 Stackpole Street to Flynn and Ober and, in exchange, Ober would provide financing through the bank to allow Kenrick to sell 8-10 Emerson Street to the Lees. Following his spaghetti dinner meeting with Flynn and Ober on October 5, 1986, where they negotiated the Stackpole Street deal, Kenrick made a note that \"I agreed at 935,000 to keep good rapport with Derek and thought with his financing ability &amp; Emily's condo sales experience we could all be happy.\" In Kenrick's 1986 appointment calendar, otherwise filled with detailed notes for most days of the year, the page for October 4-6 is missing. Within three weeks of the October 5 meeting the loan to refinance the Lee family's property on Willow Street in Melrose, submitted to WCB in August and marked \"Hold\" in Ober's handwriting, had been approved; within two more weeks, the application for the $260,000 mortgage for the Lees to purchase 8-10 Emerson Street had been completed by Kenrick and delivered by him to Ober.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the agreement between Ober and Kenrick was testified to by Chung Lee. She testified that Kenrick told her, in explaining why he sold 222 Stackpole Street to Flynn and Ober, that \"Mr. Ober can lend me the money because he's the Bank President. So, you know, that will work out very well.\" When asked what the relationship was between the Stackpole Street deal and Kenrick's sale of other properties, including 8-10 Emerson Street, she answered first, \"Well, because if Bert [Kenrick] helps Derek Ober, Derek Ober can help Bert to sell other properties.\" When asked again what Kenrick had said about the relationship between the different deals, she answered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Bert sold it to Derek, Stackpole Street, that's why he can sell his Tuttle Street commercial properties. And 8-10 Emerson Street, he can sell. And he can also sell Methuen property at 175 Haverhill Street, for I think, a million dollars or $900,000. I cannot remember. But he can sell that because Bert help Derek Ober to make money. That way, you know, he can help Bert later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chung Lee married Kenrick in October 1988 and was still married to him at the time of trial in October 1997, although divorce proceedings were then pending. She and her parents continued to own the Emerson Street property, but had to obtain an additional loan from WCB to cover cash flow problems. Eventually, after the tenants were forced to move out when Chung Lee (now Chung Kenrick) contaminated the building in attempting to remove lead paint, she defaulted on the mortgage and filed for bankruptcy. The bank wrote off a loss of $119,645.84 on the Emerson Street mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. DGB Realty Trust</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1985, Ober formed the DGB Realty Trust with WCB Treasurer Glenn Gates and William Upton, a retired local police officer. DGB bought three condominium units in Hudson, Massachusetts, and financed the purchases through Greater Boston Bank. DGB lost money from the start, and its checking account at WCB soon contained insufficient money to pay the trust's bills. To cover the shortfall, Ober decided to issue a demand loan from WCB to DGB for $15,000 on December 4, 1986. On December 11, 1987, the amount of the demand loan was increased to $25,000. Although there was testimony that some bank employees, and possibly some members of the Board of Directors, knew of the interest of Ober and Gates in DGB, three directors testified that Ober did not disclose the demand loan to the Board. In January 1988, the DGB demand loan was paid off with the proceeds of a new demand loan in the name of William Upton. Although the new loan was in Upton's name alone, Ober and Gates were still each responsible for one-third of the debt. Ober and Upton paid off their shares, but Gates still owed money on his at the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The demand loans did not turn DGB into a profitable venture, and on multiple occasions checks were written on DGB's account at WCB although there were insufficient funds to cover them. At that time WCB did not offer its customers overdraft protection or lines of credit. If a check was presented for payment with insufficient funds in the account, customers were typically allowed to make it good by depositing funds on the same day the check was presented; if they could not, the check bounced. Apparently checks were sometimes held for longer periods for bank employees or Board members. On Ober's instructions, however, DGB checks were held for unprecedented lengths of time, after the checks were paid and without sufficient funds in DGB's account to cover them. Fourteen checks, totaling over $36,000, were held for a total of 576 days; no checks bounced, and DGB payed no interest or fees. The last of these was the largest: check number 182, in the amount of $6,780.42, was presented for payment, and paid, on March 17, 1988, but there were insufficient funds in the DGB account to cover it until January 6, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Ober Deposition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The WCB Board of Directors fired Ober and Gates amid allegations of misconduct in 1991. In 1993, WCB brought an action against North American Specialty Insurance Company to recover on a fidelity bond for losses to the bank allegedly caused by the fraudulent conduct of Ober, Gates, and Attorney Kimball. The suit was brought in Massachusetts Superior Court and removed by the defendant to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. As a part of discovery in that action, Ober, then living in Florida, was deposed under oath on March 10 and 11, 1994. Ober was asked, \"Now, Mr. Kimball drew a realty trust entitled D, ampersand, E Realty Trust, D &amp; E Realty Trust. Are you familiar with that?\" He answered, \"No.\" Ober was also asked, \"Did you ever participate in the making of a loan where you had an undisclosed interest?\" He again answered, \"No.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury issued a twenty-two count indictment against Kenrick and Ober on December 18, 1996. The indictment charged Kenrick with conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, bank bribery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 215(a), and three counts of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. It charged Ober with conspiracy, bank bribery, seventeen counts of bank fraud, and two counts of perjury, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623. The case was tried to a jury from September 15 to October 27, 1997. The jury found Kenrick guilty on one count of bank fraud and Ober guilty on four counts of bank fraud and one count of perjury. They were acquitted on all other counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON BANK FRAUD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kenrick and Ober argue that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that they could not be convicted of bank fraud unless they intended to harm WCB.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Because they failed to raise this objection before the district court, we review for plain error. See United States v.

Here, there is not alleged--effectively, there hasn't been any evidence offered--that there was an intent to cause a loss to some other person. Here, we're dealing with allegations that there was to be some benefit to Mr. Ober, to Mr. Kenrick, or to people that Mr. Kenrick was concerned about.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also separately defined \"intent to defraud\": \"To act with intent to defraud means to act wilfully with a specific intent to deceive or cheat or for the purpose of either causing some financial gain to another or one's self [sic].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel that first considered this case agreed with the defendants that intent to defraud necessarily includes an \"intent to harm\" the bank, and that the district court erred by omitting this requirement from its jury instructions. The panel further held that there was no plain error. After further consideration of the intent issue, the en banc court, including the panel members, arrives at a different conclusion about the meaning of intent to defraud. We now hold, for the reasons set forth below, that the intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction is an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel addressed the intent question in the terms that the defendants posed it--whether evidence of an intent to deceive a bank and to enrich oneself or another person would support a bank fraud conviction without evidence of an intent to harm the bank. The panel's answer that proof of intent to harm was required was based on precedents from other circuits and an interpretation of the opinion of the Supreme Court in McNally v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111945\"><a href=\"/opinion/111945/mcnally-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span> </a></span>(1987), a case in which the Supreme Court held that the mail fraud statute does not reach \"honest services\" fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> By its terms, however, McNally does not require proof of \"intent to harm\" as an element of bank fraud, and there are no Supreme Court precedents that define the intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction. There is also no consensus among the circuits on the issue. Moreover, the \"intent to harm\" formulation of the panel contained an ambiguity that could not be dispelled easily.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arriving at our formulation of the intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction, we begin with the language of the bank fraud statute. Because neither the indictment nor the jury instructions specified the subsection of &#167; 1344 under which Kenrick and Ober were charged, we must examine both subsections. Section 1344(2) specifies an intent requirement. It prescribes a punishment for \"whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice... to obtain any of the monies, funds, credits, assets, securities or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> This language boils down to a prohibition on schemes to obtain money or other property from a bank by specified means of deception. The particular means of deception chosen are not essential to the intent element, which can therefore be defined as an intent to deceive a bank in order to obtain from it money or other property. Nothing in the language of &#167; 1344(2) indicates that \"intent to harm\" is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory text does not fully dispose of the intent question, however, because the specific language of &#167; 1344(2) cannot dictate the intent element of the general \"to defraud\" language of &#167; 1344(1). On the face of the statute, &#167; 1344(2) provides an alternative to, not a definition of, a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" in violation of &#167; 1344(1). Nothing in the text of the statute requires that the intent element of &#167; 1344(1) be defined in the same way as the intent element of &#167; 1344(2) or, for that matter, that they be defined differently.Moreover, the Supreme Court said recently in Neder v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 20 (1999), that \"none of the fraud statutes defines the phrase'scheme or artifice to defraud.'\" Yet Neder provides clear guidance on how to discern the elements of the scheme to defraud proscribed in &#167; 1344(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Neder Court addressed the question of whether materiality is an element of a scheme to defraud under the mail, wire, and bank fraud statutes. Because the statutes do not define the elements of a scheme to defraud, the Court followed the \"well-established rule of construction\" that \"Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 21, </span>23. The use of the word \"defraud\" raises a \"presumption that Congress intended to incorporate the common-law meaning of the term 'fraud' in the mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 23 </span>n.7. Since the statutory text does not rebut the presumption that Congress intended to incorporate the common-law materiality element, the Court held that \"materiality of falsehood is an element of the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 25.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neder thus requires that we look to the common-law meaning of fraud in examining the intent element of a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" in violation of &#167; 1344(1). The intent element of common-law civil fraud is well established. According to the Restatement, which the Neder Court relied on for its definition of materiality, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">22</span> </a></span>n.5 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 538 (1976)), \"One who fraudulently makes a misrepresentation... for the purpose of inducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon it, is subject to liability to the other in deceit....\" Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 525 (1976); see also W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts, &#167; 105, at 728 (5th ed. 1984) (\"[a]n intention to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from action in reliance upon the misrepresentation\" is an element of tort of deceit). Commentary roughly contemporary with the Congress that enacted the mail fraud statute in 1872 gives a similar definition of the intent element. \"It is said that a man is liable to an action for deceit if he makes a false representation to another, knowing it to be false, but intending that the other should believe and act upon it....\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 132 (1881); see also 2 Charles G. Addison, A Treatise on the Law of Torts &#167; 1174, at 398 (H.G. Wood ed., 1881) (\"[I]f a falsehood be knowingly told, with an intention that another person should believe it to be true, and act upon it,... the party telling the falsehood is responsible in damages in an action for deceit....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Common-law fraud thus requires an intent to induce action by the plaintiff in reliance on the defendant's misrepresentation. Commentators of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries agree that common-law fraud has no additional \"intent to harm\" requirement. See Prosser, supra, &#167; 107, at 741 (it is \"well settled\" that \"intent to accomplish an ultimate purpose, as to benefit the speaker, or to cause harm to the one addressed,\" is \"of no importance\" except to punitive damages); 2 Addison, supra, &#167; 1174, at 404 (\"[I]t is not necessary to prove that the false representation was made from a corrupt motive of gain to the defendant, or a wicked motive of injury to the plaintiff....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common-law element of intent to induce action by the plaintiff in reliance on the defendant's misrepresentation translates directly into the criminal bank fraud context, where a guilty defendant intends to induce the bank to act--i.e., to part with money or other property--in reliance on his deceit or misrepresentation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Referring to an intent to induce reliance is potentially confusing to a jury, however, because it may erroneously suggest that actual reliance by the bank is also an element of the crime, as it is an element of common-law civil fraud. The Supreme Court has said that the common-law elements of justifiable reliance and damages \"plainly have no place in the federal fraud statutes.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Neder,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>. This potential for confusion is avoided by speaking simply of an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property. We see no substantive difference between an intent to induce a bank to part with money in reliance on deceit or misrepresentation and an intent to deceive a bank in order to obtain from it money or other property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter formulation is consistent with the text of &#167; 1344(2). It is also similar to language we have used in several cases. We have said, quoting an oft-cited Third Circuit case, that a bank fraud scheme must be \"intended to deceive others in order to obtain something of value, such as money, from the institution to be deceived.\" United States v.

Considering Ober's interest in the transaction and his position as WCB president, the jury could infer that he caused the loan to be made and either altered the Board minutes himself or caused them to be altered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could further have concluded that Ober intended to deceive WCB in order to obtain the Stackpole Street loan. Furthermore, although not necessary for conviction, as we discuss below in connection with Count 4, the jury could have found--based on the size of the loan, the location of the property outside WCB's usual lending area, the speculative nature of the condominium conversion, Flynn's lack of history of business with WCB, and the fact that Ober's interest in the loan violated Massachusetts banking law--that WCB would not have made the loan if all the material facts had been revealed. A rational jury could have found Ober guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on Count 5.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Count 4 (Bank Fraud)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober and Kenrick were both found guilty of bank fraud in connection with the 8-10 Emerson Street transaction. The government's allegation as to this transaction was essentially that it was a separate execution of the same scheme to defraud WCB charged in Count 5.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The government alleged that Kenrick and Ober entered into a secret agreement whereby Kenrick would sell 222 Stackpole Street to Ober and Flynn, giving Ober the opportunity to make a large profit by converting the property to condominiums and Kenrick the chance to avoid the impending increase in the capital gains tax; in exchange, Ober would make financing available through WCB to Chung Lee and her parents to buy 8-10 Emerson Street, allowing Kenrick the same large tax advantage on that sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, especially Chung Lee's testimony,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> was sufficient to allow the jury to find that there was such a secret agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Like the Stackpole Street mortgage, then, the Emerson Street mortgage was part of a scheme in which Ober deceptively took WCB's funds, and placed WCB at risk of loss, for his personal benefit. There were differences between the two executions of the scheme, of course. The benefit to Ober from Emerson Street was only indirect; he fraudulently obtained the money in the form of a loan to the Lees, not to himself, and he made no money from that transaction in isolation. The jury could have found, however, that he indirectly benefitted because the Emerson Street loan made possible the Stackpole Street purchase from which Ober garnered a substantial profit. The Emerson Street mortgage was approved by the WCB Board of Directors, but Ober never disclosed to them the existence of the secret quid-pro-quo agreement. Both loans benefitted Ober while exposing WCB to potential loss. No actual pecuniary loss resulted directly from the Stackpole Street loan, but the bank lost $119,645.84 when the Lees defaulted on the Emerson Street loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Kenrick and Ober attempt to shift the focus from their nondisclosure of the secret agreement onto the financial status of the Lees. They argue that the Lees were creditworthy borrowers who would have been granted a loan in any event, and that this fact precludes conviction on Count 4. At least two circuits have held, however, that the creditworthiness of the borrower is no defense to bank fraud when there is concealment of an insider interest in the transaction.

Doke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762555\"><a href=\"/opinion/762555/united-states-v-maurice-h-doke-larry-w-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 245-46 (5th Cir. 1999); United States v.

They mistake the character of the falsehood required for conviction by arguing, in effect, that it must have actually induced the bank to make a loan that would not otherwise have been made. On the contrary, to be criminally fraudulent a defendant's deceptive course of conduct must be material, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Neder,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, and it must be directed at obtaining money or other property from the bank, but there is no requirement that it actually cause the bank to change its behavior, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 24-25 </a></span>(\"The common-law requirements of 'justifiable reliance' and 'damages[]'... plainly have no place in the federal fraud statutes.\"). A falsehood can be material<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> even if it did not in fact induce the bank to alter its conduct, although if such alteration did occur it is obviously probative of materiality. A misrepresentation about a borrower's creditworthiness can certainly be a material falsehood that supports a bank fraud conviction, but a different falsehood is also sufficient if it is material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence that Kenrick and Ober had a secret quid-pro-quo agreement that gave Ober an indirect financial interest in the Emerson Street loan, and that Kenrick applied for the loan on the Lees' behalf and Ober approved it and presented it to the Board of Directors for ratification while concealing the material fact of that agreement. On the basis of that evidence, a rational jury could have found them both guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on Count 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Counts 18 and 20 (Bank Fraud)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober was found guilty of two counts of bank fraud in connection with loans to the DGB Realty Trust, which Ober owned with Glenn Gates and William Upton. Count 18 concerned WCB's $15,000 demand loan to DGB, which was increased to $25,000 in December 1987, was never disclosed to or ratified by the Board of Directors, and was succeeded by a loan in the name of Upton that had not been paid off at the time of trial. Count 20 concerned Ober's practice of having DGB checks paid, even though there were insufficient funds in the DGB checking account, and held for long periods until there was enough money in the account to cover them--thus essentially providing Ober and his partners with undisclosed interest-free loans. The indictment alleged, and the evidence showed, that one check in the amount of $6,780.42 was thus held for over nine months. The evidence was sufficient to find Ober guilty on both counts. Ober concealed from the Board the plainly material fact that he was putting bank assets in his own pocket by means of undisclosed loans that put the bank at significant risk of loss and that were eventually repaid either incompletely or without interest. In short, the evidence on these counts, like the evidence on Counts 4 and 5, suggested that Ober treated WCB as his personal piggy bank, the assets of which he felt free to dispose of by loans to himself, his associates, or their designees. On that basis a rational jury could have found Ober guilty of bank fraud as we have defined it above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Count 22 (Perjury)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober was convicted of perjury for denying, under oath, that he was familiar with the D &amp; E Realty Trust and that he had ever participated in making a loan in which he had an undisclosed interest. As recounted above, there was evidence that Ober was present when the D &amp; E Realty Trust was executed, owned a half interest in it, and received half of its net income. There was also evidence that he participated in making undisclosed loans to the Riverview Development Trust and the DGB Realty Trust while having an interest in each trust. On the basis of that evidence, the jury could have concluded that both of Ober's statements--which he stipulated were material--were false and that he made them willfully. See United States v. Cardales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198339\"><a href=\"/opinion/198339/united-states-v-julio-cardales/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 558 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span> </span>(1999) (elements of perjury are \"falsity, materiality, and willfulness\"). Although Ober now argues that the question whether he was \"familiar with\" the D &amp; E Realty Trust was ambiguous, there was sufficient evidence to prove that his denial was false on any reasonable interpretation of the question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. OBER'S DUE PROCESS CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober raises two additional arguments, neither of which merits extended discussion. He contends first that he was denied due process as a result of the government's alleged delay in seeking an indictment on the bank fraud charges for approximately three years after its investigation was completed. To succeed on such a claim, a defendant must demonstrate \"that the preindictment delay caused him actual, substantial prejudice [and] that the prosecution orchestrated the delay to gain a tactical advantage over him.\" United States v. Stokes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197523\"><a href=\"/opinion/197523/united-states-v-stokes/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing United States v.

Ober can show neither; instead, he offers only \"mere speculation and bare allegations,\" which are clearly insufficient to make out a due process violation. United States v. McCoy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593173\"><a href=\"/opinion/593173/united-states-v-james-w-mccoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ober also argues that the district court violated his due process rights by preventing him from recross-examining an expert witness, appraiser Calvin Hastings, called by Kenrick to testify to the value of 222 Stackpole Street. The court barred Kenrick from conducting a redirect examination of Hastings as a sanction for Kenrick's failure--which was not discovered until the government's cross-examination--to disclose Hastings's report to the government. The court permitted Ober's attorney, who had already cross-examined Hastings, to begin recross, with instructions that it be limited to the scope of the government's cross-examination. When Ober's attorney began by asking Hastings whether he had expected he would be cross-examined on the report, the court interrupted him, stopped the examination, and excused the witness. Ober neither objected nor made an offer of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has \"extensive discretion\" in controlling recross-examination. United States v. Sorrentino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430882\"><a href=\"/opinion/430882/united-states-v-staniford-a-sorrentino/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>, 885 (1st Cir. 1984). Here the court stopped the recross because it concluded that Ober's attorney did not intend to re-examine Hastings on matters within the scope of the government's cross, but instead to conduct, in effect, the redirect that Kenrick's counsel could not. This is exactly the sort of judgment call that we should not second-guess. Considering that Ober had already had an opportunity to cross-examine Hastings, the court's limitation of his recross-examination was not an abuse of its extensive discretion, let alone a due process violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The jury was also told that the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O required a bank officer to disclose his interest in a loan to the bank's board of directors and to abstain from voting on the loan.

To the extent that Ober also makes a separate argument that the court erred by not requiring proof that the bank in fact lost money as a result of his conduct, he is clearly incorrect: section 1344 by its terms punishes not merely successful frauds, but any execution or attempted execution of a scheme to defraud a bank.

Nevertheless, a juror who failed to grasp the subtlety of the explanation might easily believe that a defendant could not be convicted of bank fraud unless his desire was to injure the bank rather than to enrich himself, and thereby mistakenly acquit a defendant who clearly had an intent to harm in the broad sense defined by the panel, i.e., frustrating the bank's right to control the disposition of its assets.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  As the Supreme Court explained in McNally, this language and the nearly identical language in the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1343, dates to a 1909 amendment to the mail fraud statute.

Even if he is correct, his significant financial interest in the transaction was still a material fact that he had a duty to disclose; its unenforceability does not preclude his conviction. See United States v. Henderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"665997\"><a href=\"/opinion/665997/united-states-v-kenneth-p-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></a></span>, 922-23 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p>  We note that Ober's fraud was hardly novel. We have upheld the bank fraud convictions of bank insiders for making loans in which they had undisclosed interests. See United States v.

Woodward, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198059\"><a href=\"/opinion/198059/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p>  A finding that this quid-pro-quo agreement existed is necessary to sustain the convictions on Count 4 because, the government's arguments to the contrary on appeal notwithstanding, its existence is the one material fact that the defendants allegedly concealed from WCB with respect to the Emerson Street transaction. The jury's verdict on Count 4 may therefore be logically inconsistent with its verdict on Counts 1, 2, and 3, finding both defendants not guilty of conspiracy and bank bribery. Inconsistency of this sort, however, does not affect our analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence on the counts for which the defendants were convicted. See United States v. Powell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111286\"><a href=\"/opinion/111286/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 67-69 (1984).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p>  According to the Supreme Court,</p>\n        <p>[A] matter is material if:</p>\n        <p>\"(a) a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question; or</p>\n        <p>\"(b) the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know that its recipient regards or is likely to regard the matter as important in determining his choice of action, although a reasonable man would not so regard it.\"</p>\n        <p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Neder,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">22</span> </a></span>n.5 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 538 (1976)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p>  The jury might have thought that Kenrick stood in a somewhat different position from Ober. Because he owed no fiduciary duty to WCB and had no power to cause it to make the loan, it could perhaps be argued that he did not himself execute the scheme to defraud. The bank fraud charge against Kenrick, however, was alternatively premised on an aiding and abetting theory. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. Even if Kenrick did not execute the scheme, there was sufficient evidence that he \"associated himself with the venture, participated in it as something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed,\" United States v.
