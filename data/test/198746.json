Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n          Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nMichael Elbery on brief pro se.\r\nDouglas I. Louison and Merrick, Louison &amp; Costello on brief\r\nfor appellee Bradford N. Louison.\r\n\nDecember 15, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Appellant Michael Elbery appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee\r\nBradford N. Louison, as well as from the district court's denial of\r\nappellant's request, made under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), to conduct\r\nfurther discovery and the district court's entry of separate\r\njudgment in favor of Louison under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  We\r\naffirm the latter two decisions of the district court for the\r\nreasons set out in the magistrate judge's Findings and\r\nRecommendation, dated August 12, 1998, and the district judge's\r\nOrder, dated February 17, 1999.  As for the grant of summary\r\njudgment, we agree with the reasoning of the district court as set\r\nout in the Findings and Recommendation.  We add only the following\r\ncomments.\r\nEven assuming, without deciding, that appellant was\r\ninvestigated as a suspect in the E-Z Mini Storage fire, we do not\r\nbelieve that he has presented sufficient facts to show that Louison\r\never agreed with the Shrewsbury police to engage in this\r\ninvestigation or to engage in a frame-up of appellant.  This, of\r\ncourse, is fatal to appellant's claim.  That is, he only has sued\r\nLouison as a conspirator.\r\nSpecifically, in his affidavit in opposition to summary\r\njudgment, appellant avers, at most, that Louison knew that\r\nappellant was an arson co-defendant, along with Robert Breen. \r\nHowever, the mere knowledge that appellant was being investigated\r\nfor the E-Z Mini Storage arson just does not support an inference\r\nthat Louison had any part in the investigation or even agreed with\r\nthe police that they should conduct such an investigation. \r\nSignificantly, appellant has presented no evidence concerning\r\nLouison's relationship with any Shrewsbury police officer and no\r\nevidence regarding any contacts Louison had with the Shrewsbury\r\npolice.  The fact that Louison was representing the police is\r\ninsufficient, standing alone, to require a factfinder to decide\r\nwhether Louison was involved in a conspiracy with the police.\r\nThis leaves appellant's contention that certain police\r\ndocuments were falsified.  First is appellant's allegation that the\r\nIOU was forged and that Louison must have been involved in the\r\nforgery because he was the only one of the Shrewsbury defendants\r\nwho had access to a piece of paper with appellant's fingerprints on\r\nit.  Even assuming the forgery of the IOU (which, we think, is\r\nquite a leap), the inference that Louison obtained the paper for\r\nthis nefarious undertaking is pure speculation and conjecture,\r\nunsupported by anything concrete.  As we have stated, \"[w]hile the\r\nsummary judgment mantra requires us to draw every reasonable\r\ninference in favor of the nonmoving party, inferences, to qualify,\r\nmust flow rationally from the underlying facts; that is, a\r\nsuggested inference must ascend to what common sense and human\r\nexperience indicates is an acceptable level of probability.\" \r\nNational Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 743 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).  Here, the probability that Louison provided the police\r\nwith a piece of paper to forge the IOU is practically nil.\r\nNext, appellant contends that the August 1994 Investigation\r\nand Incident Reports which discuss Breen as a suspect (Exhibits A\r\nand I) and the Property Detail Listing (Exhibit H) were fabricated\r\nand that Louison knew, or should have known, of the fabrication. \r\nIn support of the inference that Exhibits A and I were fabricated,\r\nappellant states that (1) he never had heard of a suspect named\r\nBreen, (2) the police, in 1994, were investigating the manager of\r\nE-Z Mini Storage as the arsonist, and (3) the reports never were\r\nproduced during discovery in appellant's 1994 criminal prosecution\r\non the gun charges.  We do not think that these facts, viewed in\r\nthe light most hospitable to appellant, are sufficient to enable a\r\nfinding favorable to appellant on the question of Louison's\r\ninvolvement in a plan to fabricate.  See Euromotion, Inc. v. BMW of\r\nNorth America, Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st Cir. 1998).  Rather,\r\nthe only inference this evidence supports is that appellant was not\r\naware of all of the facts surrounding the arson investigation until\r\n1997, when he received discovery in the Sklut case.\r\nAs for Exhibit H (the Property Detail Listing), appellant, in\r\nhis affidavit, reports Louison as saying that he (Louison) \"will\r\nhave to go to the court and report this (Ex. H) pleading if you are\r\ngoing to sue me.  I will have to retract that report (Ex. H) if\r\nyour [sic] going to do this.\"  See Appellant's Affidavit,  26. \r\nThe first difficulty we see with this alleged statement is that,\r\nsince the reference to Exhibit H is in parentheses, it is\r\nquestionable whether Louison was, in fact, even referring to\r\nExhibit H, or whether the reference was added by appellant.  If the\r\nlatter, there is no specific evidence that the document Louison\r\nstated he would have to retract was Exhibit H.  In any event, even\r\nassuming Louison was referring to Exhibit H, the above statement\r\ndoes not support the inference that he wanted to retract Exhibit H\r\nbecause it had been falsified; rather, Louison gives no reason for\r\nthe need for retraction.  There thus is insufficient basis for a\r\nfactfinder to find that Louison was involved in a plan to falsify\r\nevidence.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Appellant's\r\nmotion to amend the record is denied.\n",
