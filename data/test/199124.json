Claims of deplorable working and\n\nliving conditions for migrant workers at DeCoster Egg Farms, a\n\nlarge Maine employer, were made in a civil rights action filed\n\nin May of 1998.   The thrust of the complaint was that workers of\n\nMexican descent, be they American or Mexican citizens, were\n\ntreated harshly because of their Mexican background, and that\n\nwhite, non-Mexican workers fared better.    The primary cause of\n\naction asserted violations of the workers' civil rights under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981.      The complaint also asserted other claims,\n\nincluding claims of unsafe and unsanitary housing under the\n\nMigrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1801 et seq.      The complaint was filed by fourteen\n\nindividuals, who proposed to represent a class of \"all former\n\nand current migrant farm workers of Mexican race and descent\"\n\nemployed by Austin J. DeCoster and DeCoster Egg Farm.1\n\n\n\n\n    1     Austin J. DeCoster owned DeCoster Egg Farm individually\nuntil 1997. Originally, the complaint named as defendants Mr.\nDeCoster and two successor companies, Quality Egg of New\nEngland, LLC, and Maine AG, LLC. Although plaintiffs later added\nother successor companies, those companies did not move to\ndismiss Mexico from the case and are not appellees in this\nappeal.\n\n                               -3-\n\f    The other plaintiff was the Government of Mexico, the\n\nEstados Unidos Mexicanos, which said it was appearing in its\n\nparens patriae capacity to protect its citizens and its own\n\nquasi-sovereign interests.   It is unusual for a foreign nation\n\nto claim standing under the parens patriae doctrine; more common\n\nis the appearance of other nations in suits to protect their own\n\ndistinct interests or as amicus curiae in actions that may\n\naffect them. See, e.g., National Foreign Trade Council v.\n\nNatsios, 181 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 1999), aff'd sub nom. Crosby v.\n\nNational Foreign Trade Council, 120 S. Ct. 2288 (2000); United\n\nStates v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997),\n\ncert. denied, 522 U.S. 1044 (1998).   Neither the Supreme Court\n\nnor this court has addressed the question of whether the parens\n\npatriae doctrine may be so employed by a foreign nation.    The\n\ndistrict court dismissed Mexico as a plaintiff for lack of\n\nstanding. See Estados Unidos Mexicanos v. DeCoster, 59 F. Supp.\n\n2d 120, 123-25 (D. Me. 1999).       At Mexico’s request, final\n\njudgment was entered as to this issue while the underlying\n\naction of the fourteen individual plaintiffs proceeded.2     We\n\n\n    2     The district court has since denied class action\ncertification and granted defendants’ motion for summary\n\n                              -4-\n\freview the determination of lack of standing de novo, see, e.g.,\n\nSerpa Corp. v. McWane, Inc., 199 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1999), and\n\naffirm the dismissal of Mexico as a party to this action.\n\n\n\nThe Doctrine of Parens Patriae\n\n     \"Parens patriae means literally 'parent of the country.'\"\n\nAlfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 600\n\n(1982).   The doctrine has developed as to States of the United\n\nStates.   It creates an exception to normal rules of standing\n\napplied to private citizens in recognition of the special role\n\nthat a State plays in pursuing its quasi-sovereign interests in\n\n\"the well-being of its populace.\"        Id. at 602; see also Georgia\n\nv. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U.S. 230, 237 (1907) (a State \"has\n\nan   interest   independent   of   and   behind   the   titles   of   its\n\ncitizens, in all the earth and air within its domain\").3          It is\n\na judicially created exception that has been narrowly construed.\n\nThe most complete explanation of the parens patriae doctrine in\n\n\njudgment as to some of plaintiffs’ claims.              See Ramirez v.\nDeCoster, 194 F.R.D. 348 (D. Me. 2000).\n     3    A State's quasi-sovereign interest is thus distinct from, for\nexample, its sovereign interest in protecting and maintaining its\nboundaries and its proprietary interest in owning land or conducting a\nbusiness venture. See Snapp, 458 U.S. at 601-02.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fits modern incarnation,4 as applied to the States of this\n\ncountry, appears in the Supreme Court's opinion in Snapp:\n\n    In order to maintain [a parens patriae] action, the State\n    must articulate an interest apart from the interests of\n    particular private parties, i.e., the State must be more\n    than a nominal party. The State must express a\n    quasi-sovereign interest. Although the articulation of such\n    interests is a matter for case-by-case development --\n    neither an exhaustive formal definition nor a definitive\n    list of qualifying interests can be presented in the\n    abstract -- certain characteristics of such interests are\n    so far evident. These characteristics fall into two general\n    categories. First, a State has a quasi-sovereign interest\n    in the health and well-being -- both physical and economic\n\n\n    4     The parens patriae action has its roots in the common-\nlaw concept of the \"royal prerogative,\" that is, the power of\nthe king, as \"father of the country,\" to act as the guardian for\nthose under legal disabilities to act for themselves.\nSee Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 257 (1972)\n(describing king's role as \"'the general guardian of all\ninfants, idiots, and lunatics'\" (quoting 3 William Blackstone,\nCommentaries *47)); see also George B. Curtis, The Checkered\nCareer of Parens Patriae: The State as Parent or Tyrant?, 25\nDePaul L. Rev. 895, 898 (1976) (\"[p]arens patriae was\n[originally] limited to a parental concern for dependent\nclasses\").    While American courts adopted this common-law\nconcept, they did so -- consistent with the notion of\nlegislative supremacy -- in the form of a legislative\nprerogative that was \"to be exercised [by States] in the\ninterests of humanity, and for the prevention of injury to those\nwho cannot protect themselves.\" Snapp, 458 U.S. at 600 (quoting\nMormon Church v. United States, 136 U.S. 1, 57 (1890)). The\nSupreme Court expanded the doctrine by determining that an\nindividual State could sue under parens patriae on behalf of all\nof its citizens.    See Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. at 257-58\n(citing Louisiana v. Texas, 176 U.S. 1 (1900), as signaling the\nbeginning of this trend).\n\n                              -6-\n\f    -- of its residents in general.    Second, a State has a\n    quasi-sovereign interest in not being discriminatorily\n    denied its rightful status within the federal system.\n\n458 U.S. at 607.        Mexico stakes its claim in our case on this\n\nfirst type of quasi-sovereign interest, i.e., its interest in\n\nthe general health and well-being of workers of Mexican descent\n\nemployed by defendants.           We do not reach the issue of whether\n\nthere is a quasi-sovereign interest here, but simply assume that\n\nMexico   has   interests     apart    from   those    of   the    individual\n\nplaintiffs and is more than a nominal party.\n\n    The question here presented is whether a foreign nation\n\nwhich    asserts only quasi-sovereign interests and not its own\n\nproprietary or sovereign interests should be afforded standing\n\nas parens patriae.         We consider this to be a question of\n\nprudential standing, and not an Article III question.                      See,\n\ne.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for\n\nSeparation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).\n\nOur answer is that parens patriae standing should not be\n\nrecognized     in   a   foreign    nation    unless   there      is   a   clear\n\nindication of intent to grant such standing expressed by the\n\nSupreme Court or by the two coordinate branches of government.\n\nSee, e.g., Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f205, 209 (1972) (finding statute clearly granted standing to\n\nprivate plaintiffs asserting housing discrimination claim).\n\n\n\nSupreme Court Doctrine\n\n    The Supreme Court has never recognized parens patriae\n\nstanding   in   a   foreign   nation    where   only   quasi-sovereign\n\ninterests are at stake.       The justifications offered to support\n\nparens patriae standing in the individual States of the Union\n\nare not applicable here. Further, several doctrines of judicial\n\nrestraint counsel against recognition of such standing.\n\n    Standing of foreign nations to bring suit in the federal\n\ncourts has been recognized in cases in which the foreign nation\n\nhas suffered a direct injury.       \"There is no question but that\n\nforeign States may sue private parties in the federal courts.\"\n\nPrincipality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 323 n.2\n\n(1934).    That standing has been conditioned on the requirement\n\nthat the foreign nation satisfy the usual standing requirements\n\nimposed on individuals or domestic corporations.          The Supreme\n\nCourt \"has long recognized the rule that a foreign nation is\n\ngenerally entitled to prosecute any civil claim in the courts of\n\nthe United States upon the same basis as a domestic corporation\n\n                                  -8-\n\for individual might do.\"     Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India,\n\n434 U.S. 308, 318-19 (1978).        For example, foreign nations may\n\nbring treble damages antitrust claims under the Clayton Act to\n\naddress their direct injuries.        Id. at 319.5\n\n    There is no argument made here that Mexico could meet normal\n\nstanding    requirements    applied     to   individuals     or   domestic\n\ncorporations.     Indeed,    there    is     some   danger   that   Mexico\n\n\"advances    abstract   questions     of     wide   public   significance\n\nessentially     amounting    to      generalized      grievances      more\n\n\n\n    5     The antitrust field has its own rules. Even a State\nof the Union may not bring such actions in a parens patriae\ncapacity claiming general injury to its economy because it has\nnot, in that capacity, suffered an injury to its business or\nproperty within the meaning of § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.\n§ 15. See Kansas v. Utilicorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 205-\n06 (1990) (State not a proper plaintiff as parens patriae for\nits citizens who paid inflated prices for natural gas when\nlawsuit already included as plaintiffs the public utilities that\nwere the direct purchasers of the gas); Illinois Brick Co. v.\nIllinois, 431 U.S. 720, 726-29 (1977) (no injury to Illinois as\nindirect purchaser of of concrete blocks under § 4 of the\nClayton Act).    Indeed, the Court has noted that even the\ncreation of the new procedural device of parens patriae actions\nby States on behalf of their citizens to enforce existing rights\nof recovery under § 4 of the Clayton Act, see 15 U.S.C. §\n15c(a)(1), \"'creates no new substantive liability' . . . [but\nwas] intended only as 'an alternative means . . . for the\nvindication of existing substantive claims,'\" Illinois Brick,\n431 U.S. at 733-34 n.14 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-499 (1975),\n1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2572, 2578).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fappropriately   addressed    to    the    representative   branches.\"\n\nBenjamin v. Aroostock Med. Ctr., Inc., 57 F.3d 101, 104 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n    Mexico’s    argument    is    based   on   the   Supreme   Court's\n\nrecognition of standing in the States of the Union under the\n\nparens patriae doctrine.    By analogy, Mexico says, it should be\n\ntreated in like manner.     Such an analogy is not implausible;\n\nindeed, in granting parens patriae standing to the States, the\n\nSupreme Court has analogized the States to foreign nations. See\n\nMissouri v. Illinois, 180 U.S. 208, 241 (1901). But the analogy\n\nis incomplete, and so the elegant symmetry of Mexico’s argument\n\nfails.\n\n    The primary justification for recognizing parens patriae\n\nstanding in the States, repeated throughout a century’s Supreme\n\nCourt caselaw, derives from important principles underlying our\n\nfederal system.    First, the States have surrendered certain\n\naspects of their sovereignty to the federal government and, in\n\nreturn, are given recourse to solve their problems with other\n\nStates.   In Missouri v. Illinois, supra, the Court recognized\n\nparens patriae standing in the State of Missouri to sue the\n\nState of Illinois for sending sewage into the Mississippi River\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthat poisoned its drinking water, endangered the health of its\n\nresidents, and impaired the commercial value of its towns and\n\ncities.   See Missouri, 180 U.S. at 241.     The Court noted:\n\n    If Missouri were an independent and sovereign State all\n    must admit that she could seek a remedy by negotiation,\n    and, that failing, by force. Diplomatic powers and the\n    right to make war having been surrendered to the general\n    government, it was to be expected that upon the latter\n    would be devolved the duty of providing a remedy . . . .\n\nId. at 241; see generally Ann Woolhandler & Michael G. Collins,\n\nState Standing, 81 Va. L . Rev. 387, 446-47 (1995) (around the\n\nturn of twentieth century, the Court \"began allowing states to\n\nvindicate in federal court their general interest in protecting\n\ntheir citizens\" through interstate pollution actions to enjoin\n\npublic nuisances).     Second,    States   require   a   sufficiently\n\nindependent forum to resolve their disputes with one another.\n\nAccordingly, under Article III of the Constitution, the Supreme\n\nCourt has original and exclusive jurisdiction over actions\n\nbetween two or more States.        See 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a); see\n\nalso Georgia v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 450 (1945)\n\n(\"The original jurisdiction of this Court is one of the mighty\n\ninstruments which the framers of the Constitution provided so\n\nthat adequate machinery might be available for the peaceful\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fsettlement of disputes between States and between a State and\n\ncitizens of another State.\"); see generally Erwin Chemerinsky,\n\nFederal Jurisdiction § 10.3.1, at 580 (2d ed. 1994) (\"Without a\n\ntribunal to resolve their differences, states might resort to\n\narmed conflicts with one another or other forms of coercive\n\nbehavior.\").6    Indeed, the Court's expansion of parens patriae\n\ndoctrine beyond its traditional common law parameters took place\n\nin   cases   involving   the   Court's   exercise   of   its   original\n\njurisdiction to decide controversies between States or between\n\na State and a citizen of another State -- an area in which the\n\nCourt acted as an arbiter between quasi-sovereign interests.\n\nSee Curtis, The Checkered Career of Parens Patriae, 25 DePaul L.\n\n\n\n\n     6    Of course, for the Court to exercise original\njurisdiction, such actions must meet the Article III standing\nrequirements and be \"susceptible of judicial solution.\"\nLouisiana v. Texas, 176 U.S. 1, 18 (1900) (accepting concept of\nparens patriae standing but finding elements of that standing\nnot presented on the facts).      Additionally, the Court can\nexercise its discretion to refuse to hear disputes between\nStates \"with an eye to promoting the most effective functioning\nof this Court within the overall federal system.\" See Texas v.\nNew Mexico, 462 U.S. 554, 570 (1983).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fRev.       at    908.     For   obvious    reasons,   neither    of    these   two\n\nfederalism justifications applies here.7\n\n       Mexico stresses that it has sued private parties, not a\n\nState, as defendants, and turns for support to a subcategory of\n\ncases in which the Supreme Court has recognized parens patriae\n\nstanding in States to sue private companies, not other States.\n\nThat aspect of the doctrine originated in Tennessee Copper Co.,\n\nsupra.            There Georgia was permitted to sue for injunctive\n\nrelief          against   defendant   copper     companies      that   allegedly\n\ndischarged noxious gasses over Georgia. Again, the Court rested\n\nits extension of the doctrine on federalism grounds:\n\n       When the states by their union made the forcible abatement\n       of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not\n       thereby agree to submit to whatever might be done. They\n       did not renounce the possibility of making reasonable\n       demands on the ground of their still remaining quasi-\n       sovereign interests; and the alternative to force is a suit\n       in this court.\n\n\n\n       7  Furthermore, federalism concerns can also limit a\nState's parens patriae standing when the suit seeks to enforce\nits citizens' rights \"in respect of their relations with the\nfederal government,\" where it is the United States, and not the\nState, that represents them as parens patriae. Massachusetts v.\nMellon, 262 U.S. 447, 485-86 (1923) (a State may not interpose\nitself to protect its citizens from the operation of allegedly\nunconstitutional federal statutes); see also Woolhandler &\nCollins, State Standing, 81 Va. L. Rev. at 491.\n\n                                          -13-\n\f206 U.S. at 237.8      While Mexico is correct to concede that it\n\nwould face additional problems if this suit had been brought\n\nagainst   a   State,   this   does   not   alter    the   fact   that   the\n\nfederalism justifications for permitting States to bring suit\n\nparens patriae against private entities are simply absent here.\n\n     Nonetheless, Mexico says that under Snapp, a more recent\n\ncase, its standing must be recognized.             Snapp involved Puerto\n\nRico's participation in the Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. § 49 et\n\nseq., which had mandated the establishment of a nationwide\n\nemployment system and encouraged the States to participate in\n\nthat system if authorized by the Secretary of Labor. See Snapp,\n\n458 U.S. at 594-95.       Puerto Rico was included in the Act’s\n\ndefinition of a State.        See id. at 594 n.1.          If unemployed\n\npersons capable of performing the labor sought could not be\n\nfound in this country, then temporary foreign workers could be\n\nbrought in.    See id. at 595.   Thus, the Act gave a preference to\n\n\n\n     8     Federalism concerns also underlay the subsequent extension\nof parens patriae standing to actions involving direct economic harm.\nSee Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 324 U.S. at 450-51 (stating that actions of\nrailroads in conspiring to fix freight rates in a manner that\ndiscriminates against Georgia shippers \"relegates [Georgia] to an\ninferior economic position among her sister States . . . . These are\nmatters of grave public concern in which Georgia has an interest apart\nfrom that of particular individuals who may be affected.\").\n\n                                 -14-\n\fUnited States workers (including citizens of Puerto Rico) for\n\nnewly available jobs in this country and prevented such workers\n\nfrom being disadvantaged by foreign workers.     See id. at 596.\n\nPuerto Rico certified more than a thousand of its workers to\n\nVirginia apple growers looking for temporary labor during the\n\n1978 harvest season.    When Virginia growers refused to hire\n\nPuerto Rican workers, including those who had already arrived in\n\nVirginia,    Puerto Rico sued for declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief.   See id. at 596-97.\n\n    The Court recognized parens patriae standing in Puerto Rico.\n\nId. at 608.      Although the Court recognized Puerto Rico’s\n\ninterest in avoiding discrimination against its citizens as a\n\nquasi-sovereign interest, it did so in the context of describing\n\nPuerto Rico’s role in the federal system.      See id. at 607-08\n\n(\"Distinct from but related to the general well-being of its\n\nresidents, the State has an interest in securing observance of\n\nthe terms under which it participates in the federal system.\").9\n\n\n\n    9     Indeed, Puerto Rico had alleged, inter alia, that the\ndiscrimination by Virginia growers deprived it of \"its right to\neffectively participate in the benefits of the Federal\nEmployment Service System of which it is a part.\" Id. at 598\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                               -15-\n\fThe Snapp Court granted standing to Puerto Rico qua State under\n\nthe Wagner-Peyser Act on two alternative grounds: 1) a State's\n\ninterest in protecting citizens from discrimination, id. at 609;\n\nand 2) a State's interest in equal participation in a federal\n\nemployment service scheme, id. at 609-10.               Here, of course,\n\nMexico   relies   only   on   the    former   ground.      While   Snapp's\n\ndiscussion of federalism principles -- e.g., its discussion of\n\na State's right to the observance of the terms of a compact by\n\nwhich it participates in the federal system, id. at 607-08 --\n\nseems to refer distinctly to the second of the two grounds of\n\nstanding, and thus the one not relied on here by Mexico, the two\n\ngrounds dovetail in that residents were being excluded from\n\nparticipation in a federal program by virtue of discrimination.\n\n\n\n    We do not read Snapp as establishing parens patriae standing\n\nin a State in the absence of federalism concerns where the\n\nquasi-sovereign    interest     at    stake   is   the     prevention   of\n\ndiscrimination against that State's            citizens.      Indeed, it\n\nremains questionable whether Snapp would permit a State to seek\n\nparens patriae standing on the basis Mexico asserts here because\n\nStates are not assigned a special role in the enforcement of 42\n\n                                    -16-\n\fU.S.C. § 1981, unlike the special role they are assigned under\n\nthe Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. § 49 et seq., which was at\n\nissue in Snapp.     But even if States could bring suits such as\n\nthis one, Mexico’s claim would still fail.       By definition, a\n\nforeign nation has no cognizable interests in our system of\n\nfederalism. And such interests are a critical element of parens\n\npatriae standing.\n\n     Nor is Mexico’s position supported by adherence to any\n\nprinciple of customary international law.        Such a principle\n\nwould provide an arguable basis on which to grant standing.\n\nMexico, however, has admitted that it knows of no such principle\n\nrecognizing parens patriae standing in foreign nations and we\n\nlikewise have found none.10    Instead, Mexico points hopefully to\n\nthe principle of comity.      The principle is well recognized but\n\nbeside the point.    Comity permits foreign nations to sue in our\n\ncourts if they meet the normal standing requirements imposed on\n\nindividuals.   See Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S.\n\n\n\n\n     10   Parens patriae is not mentioned as an established\nprinciple of international law in either the Restatement (Third)\nof Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1987) or any\nmajor treatise in the field.\n\n                                 -17-\n\f398, 408-09 (1964).     But parens patriae standing goes beyond\n\nnormal standing requirements.\n\n     Moreover, the granting of parens patriae status to foreign\n\nnations would raise concerns beyond the lack of support for such\n\nstatus in precedent or prior reasoning.            One particularly\n\ncompelling concern was thoughtfully articulated by the district\n\ncourt.   The conduct of the foreign affairs of this country is\n\ncommitted to the Executive and to the Congress.          This division\n\nof   power should give courts pause before entering this arena,\n\nabsent guidance from those other two branches.          Care should be\n\ntaken    not   to   impinge   on    the   Executive’s    treaty-making\n\nprerogatives or to assume that courts have the institutional\n\ncompetence to perform functions assigned elsewhere by the\n\nConstitution. See United States v. Kin-Hong, 110 F.3d 103, 110-\n\n11 (1st Cir.), stay denied, 520 U.S. 1206 (1997).        The Executive\n\noften requires, before extending rights to foreign nations, that\n\nthere be agreements providing for reciprocal protection of\n\nAmerican interests. The ability of the other branches to secure\n\nsuch reciprocity could be undermined if the Judiciary did not\n\nadhere to the principal of non-interference.       See United States\n\nv. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 587-88 (1st Cir.) (reciting dangers of\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthis country's penal enforcement of other countries' customs and\n\ntax laws without reciprocal enforcement of American laws), cert.\n\ndenied, 519 U.S. 905 (1996).\n\n     Mexico says that these concerns are alleviated by the act\n\nof state doctrine and the political question doctrine.           It is\n\ndifficult to see what the act of state doctrine, which has\n\ntraditionally precluded review by United States courts of\n\nofficial acts by foreign states, see Oetjen v. Central Leather\n\nCo., 246 U.S. 297, 303-04 (1918), has to do with the situation\n\nhere.11   And while there is some parallel to the political\n\nquestion doctrine, it works against Mexico.          Again, the very\n\nquestion of whether a foreign nation should be given rights to\n\nsue beyond those rights enjoyed by United States citizens raises\n\nconcerns about the allocation of responsibility among our three\n\nbranches of government.\n\n\n\n\n     11    The Court's more recent justification for the doctrine as an\nexpression of the domestic separation of powers further undermines\nMexico's argument here.       See W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co., Inc. v.\nEnvironmental Tectonics Corp., Intl., 493 U.S. 400, 404 (1990) (act of\nstate doctrine reflects \"'the strong sense of the Judicial Branch that\nits engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts\nof state may hinder' the conduct of foreign affairs\" (quoting\nSabbatino, 376 U.S. at 423)).\n\n                                 -19-\n\f    In addition, other reasons for caution stem from the rules\n\nand procedures within the federal judiciary.          As the Eighth\n\nCircuit noted in denying parens patriae status to foreign\n\ngovernments in a Sherman Act case, class actions are often the\n\npreferable vehicle to pursue claims on behalf of a country's\n\ncitizens.     See Pfizer, Inc. v. Lord, 522 F.2d 612, 617-18 (8th\n\nCir. 1975) (\"th[e] strong preference for class actions over\n\nParens patriae has been repeatedly expressed\"), cert. denied,\n\n424 U.S. 950 (1976).         Furthermore, the potential exists for\n\nconflicts between the individual litigants and the parens\n\npatriae nation plaintiff over issues of settlement, appropriate\n\nrelief, and the like. See Lisa Moscati Hawkes, Note, Parens\n\nPatriae and the Union Carbide Case: The Disaster at Bhopal\n\nContinues, 21 Cornell Int’l L.J. 181, 181-83 (1988) (discussing\n\ncase brought by government of India under the parens patriae\n\ndoctrine in which India blocked settlement offer that individual\n\nplaintiffs had wanted to accept).          But see Comment, Parens\n\nPatriae Representation in Transnational Crises: The Bhopal\n\nTragedy, 17 Cal. W. Int’l L.J. 175, 184 (1987) (suggesting that\n\nunusual circumstances surrounding Bhopal case made it ideal for\n\napplication    of   parens   patriae    doctrine).   Indeed,   relief\n\n                                 -20-\n\fobtained   by    the   parens    patriae   plaintiff   may   bar   private\n\nlitigants from later bringing suit.             See City of Tacoma v.\n\nTaxpayers of Tacoma, 357 U.S. 320, 334 (1958).               Commentators\n\nhave also suggested that, even as to individual States, parens\n\npatriae standing should be limited because \"expansive state\n\nstanding has a serious potential to undermine rather than\n\ncomplement      individual      standing   in   constitutional     cases.\"\n\nWoolhandler & Collins, State Standing, 81 Va. L . Rev. at 396.\n\n     Mexico says that there is no potential for conflict because\n\nit seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief whereas the\n\nindividual plaintiffs seek primarily monetary compensation.             In\n\nfact, the individual plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief,\n\nparticularly on behalf of the putative class. See Ramirez, 194\n\nF.R.D. at 352 (plaintiffs' seek to enjoin DeCoster \"from maintaining a\n\npolicy of discrimination against Mexicans regarding the terms and\n\nconditions of their employment\").12\n\n\n\n\n     12   While there is the problem of overlap and potential\nconflict whenever parens patriae standing is allowed, cf.\nPfizer, 522 F.2d at 618 (explaining why parens patriae actions\nlack the various safeguards contained in the class action\nrules), we do not suggest, however, that the mere presence of\npotential conflict might alone prove a sufficient basis on which\nto deny such standing.\n\n                                    -21-\n\f    To summarize, we have looked to Supreme Court precedent and\n\ndoctrine to see whether there is warrant to extend parens\n\npatriae standing to a foreign nation in this action.           There is\n\nno direct precedent allowing for such status and the federalism\n\nconcerns that animate recognition of parens patriae status in\n\nthe States are simply absent.        Moreover, there are reasons for\n\nthe courts not to recognize such standing, reasons stemming from\n\nthe assignment of the foreign relations powers to the other\n\nbranches.   There are other reasons having to do with prudential\n\nconsiderations within the courts themselves, concerns about\n\navoiding    conflict   with   the    class   action   rules   and   about\n\nundermining the role of the individual plaintiffs. All of these\n\nreasons may be overcome should the Supreme Court or other two\n\nbranches decide these policy concerns differently.              But the\n\nSupreme Court has not yet done so, and we thus turn to the other\n\ntwo branches.\n\n\n\n\nThe Coordinate Branches\n\n    What is left is the question of whether the Executive or the\n\nCongress has given any guidance on the issue before us.\n\n                                    -22-\n\f    No party contends that Congress took a position on the topic\n\nin the definition of the word \"persons\" within the meaning of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1981.           Nor does Mexico point\n\nto a treaty or executive agreement affording it special, parens\n\npatriae   standing.       Further,    Mexico     points   to   no   statute\n\nrecognizing such standing.       By contrast, Congress has expressly\n\nauthorized the United States, by its Attorney General, to\n\nenforce federal statutes and some Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nSee, e.g.,   Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-5 (1994)\n\n(authorizing   suits      for   injunctive     relief     to   enforce     an\n\nindividual's right to equal enjoyment of public accommodations);\n\nid. § 2000e-5 (authorizing suits for injunctive relief from\n\ndiscriminatory employment practices); cf. Larry W. Yackle, A\n\nWorthy Champion for Fourteenth Amendment Rights: The United\n\nStates in Parens Patriae, 92 Nw. U. L. Rev. 111, 114 (1997)\n\n(advocating parens patriae suits by the United States to enforce\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment).\n\n    To the contrary, the defendants say, Congress and the\n\nPresident have indicated that disputes such as these are not to\n\nbe heard by the courts but are instead to be governed by the\n\nNorth   American   Free    Trade     Agreement    (\"NAFTA\")     and,     more\n\n                                   -23-\n\fspecifically, by the so-called labor \"side agreement.\"             See\n\nNorth American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, Sept. 8, 9, 12,\n\nand 14, 1993, 32 I.L.M. 1499 (1993) (\"NAALC\").        Since NAFTA and\n\nNAALC govern this conflict, defendants say that these agreements\n\nprovide Mexico’s exclusive remedy and preclude resort to the\n\nfederal courts.    The NAALC establishes four levels for settling\n\nlabor law disputes, including top-level consultation between\n\nnational labor law ministers of the respective member States.\n\nSee id. art. 22, 32 I.L.M. at 1508.13     Such consultation extends\n\nto any labor law matter within the scope of the Agreement, see\n\nid., including the elimination of employment discrimination, see\n\n\n\n\n     13    Following ministerial consultations, a single Party may\ninitiate the establishment of an Evaluation Committee of Experts, which\nin turn performs an independent, non-adversarial analysis and then\nprovides recommendations covering all three Parties' labor law\nenforcement in the particular area in issue. See id. arts. 23-26, 32\nI.L.M. at 1508-09.\n\n     In addition to providing for these ministerial consultations, the\nNAALC also allows private parties to file submissions for review by a\nNational Administrative Office (NAO) established within the respective\nfederal department of labor of each member State. See id. arts. 15-16,\n21, 32 I.L.M. at 1507-08. The NAO investigates the submission (which\ninvestigation, in the United States, includes holding a public hearing)\nand issues a report. See generally Clyde Summers, NAFTA's Labor Side\nAgreement and International Labor Standards, 3 J. Small & Emerging Bus.\nL. 173 (1999).\n\n                                 -24-\n\fid. Annex 1, ¶ 7, 32 I.L.M. at 1515-16.14       If the parties are\n\nunable to resolve the matter by cooperation, NAALC provides for\n\ndispute resolution through binding arbitration.       Id. arts. 27-\n\n41, 32 I.L.M. at 1509-13.       Mexico rejoins that while NAFTA\n\ncovers disputes between governments, such as a claim by Mexico\n\nthat the United States is not enforcing its own labor laws, this\n\naction involves discrimination claims against a private party.\n\nWhile Mexico's argument is not without force, resolution of this\n\nprecise issue is not necessary.        The important point is that\n\nthere is no suggestion in NAFTA or NAALC that the other two\n\nbranches of the United States government intended to grant\n\nMexico special standing as parens patriae to pursue these\n\nclaims.15\n\n     14   Similarly, the scope of NAALC review extends to another\nParty's \"labor law, its administration, or labor market conditions in\nits territory.\" Id. art. 21, 32 I.L.M. at 1507.\n     15   To the extent that Mexico believes that the United\nStates has failed to enforce its labor laws against defendants,\nit appears that Mexico may use the mechanisms set forth in the\nNAALC. Although NAALC's arbitration mechanism would not seem to\nencompass the instant allegations of racial discrimination\nagainst defendants, see id. art. 29, 32 I.L.M. at 1509-10\n(limiting the scope of arbitration to \"the alleged persistent\npattern of failure by the Party complained against to\neffectively enforce its occupational safety and health, child\nlabor or minimum wage technical labor standards\"), Mexico could\nstill pursue these claims through the process of ministerial\n\n                                -25-\n\f     Finally, the district court commendably invited comment from\n\nthe U.S. Department of State.      The State Department, however,\n\ndeclined to comment, and thus, again, there is no indication of\n\nsupport by the Executive Branch for Mexico’s position.\n\n     Mexico’s final arguments, which are based in policy, are not\n\ninsignificant.     More than one thousand workers of Mexican\n\ndescent worked at DeCoster between 1992 and 1996. Many of these\n\ntransitory workers are poor, are isolated both geographically\n\nand culturally, are economically dependent on their employer,\n\nand are in a poor position to obtain legal services or to work\n\nwith counsel.    Amicus Farmworker Justice Fund, Inc. also points\n\nto decreased efforts by federal agencies charged with enforcing\n\nwage and hour laws in agriculture.16       Mexico, however, is not\n\nleft powerless to address these concerns. As the district court\n\nsuggested, Mexico could financially support the plaintiffs in\n\ntheir efforts or seek to participate as amicus.        Moreover, the\n\nalleged violations may be entirely appropriate for Mexico to\n\nraise with the United States though diplomatic channels.          But\n\n\nconsultation described above.\n     16   We acknowledge with appreciation the amicus briefs submitted\nby both the Farmworker Justice Fund, Inc. and the New England Legal\nFoundation.\n\n                                -26-\n\fthe   courts,   absent   the   type   of   clear   direction   discussed\n\nearlier, are not the appropriate forum for the litigation of\n\nMexico's quasi-sovereign interests.\n\n      The judgment of dismissal as to Mexico as a party plaintiff\n\nis affirmed.    No costs to either party.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\f",

The thrust of the complaint was that workers of Mexican descent, be they American or Mexican citizens, were treated harshly because of their Mexican background, and that white, non-Mexican workers fared better. The primary cause of action asserted violations of the workers' civil rights under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981. The complaint also asserted other claims, including claims of unsafe and unsanitary housing under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1801 et seq. The complaint was filed by fourteen individuals, who proposed to represent a class of \"all former and current migrant farm workers of Mexican race and descent\" employed by Austin J. DeCoster and DeCoster Egg Farm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other plaintiff was the Government of Mexico, the Estados Unidos Mexicanos, which said it was appearing in its parens patriae capacity to protect its citizens and its own quasi-sovereign interests. It is unusual for a foreign nation to claim standing under the parens patriae doctrine; more common is the appearance of other nations in suits to protect their own distinct interests or as amicus curiae in actions that may affect them. See, e.g., National Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 1999), aff'd sub nom. Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 120 S. Ct. 2288 (2000); United States v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1044 (1998). Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has addressed the question of whether the parens patriae doctrine may be so employed by a foreign nation. The district court dismissed Mexico as a plaintiff for lack of standing. See Estados Unidos Mexicanos v. DeCoster, 59 F. Supp. 2d 120, 123-25 (D. Me. 1999). At Mexico's request, final judgment was entered as to this issue while the underlying action of the fourteen individual plaintiffs proceeded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We review the determination of lack of standing de novo, see, e.g., Serpa Corp. v.

Snapp &amp; Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 600 (1982). The doctrine has developed as to States of the United States. It creates an exception to normal rules of standing applied to private citizens in recognition of the special role that a State plays in pursuing its quasi-sovereign interests in \"the well-being of its populace.\" Id. at 602; see also Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U.S. 230, 237 (1907) (a State \"has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It is a judicially created exception that has been narrowly construed. The most complete explanation of the parens patriae doctrine in its modern incarnation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> as applied to the States of this country, appears in the Supreme Court's opinion in Snapp:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to maintain [a parens patriae] action, the State must articulate an interest apart from the interests of particular private parties, i.e., the State must be more than a nominal party. The State must express a quasi-sovereign interest. Although the articulation of such interests is a matter for case-by-case development -- neither an exhaustive formal definition nor a definitive list of qualifying interests can be presented in the abstract -- certain characteristics of such interests are so far evident. These characteristics fall into two general categories. First, a State has a quasi-sovereign interest in the health and well-being -- both physical and economic -- of its residents in general. Second, a State has a quasi-sovereign interest in not being discriminatorily denied its rightful status within the federal system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">458 U.S. at 607. Mexico stakes its claim in our case on this first type of quasi-sovereign interest, i.e., its interest in the general health and well-being of workers of Mexican descent employed by defendants. We do not reach the issue of whether there is a quasi-sovereign interest here, but simply assume that Mexico has interests apart from those of the individual plaintiffs and is more than a nominal party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question here presented is whether a foreign nation which asserts only quasi-sovereign interests and not its own proprietary or sovereign interests should be afforded standing as parens patriae. We consider this to be a question of prudential standing, and not an Article III question. See, e.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982). Our answer is that parens patriae standing should not be recognized in a foreign nation unless there is a clear indication of intent to grant such standing expressed by the Supreme Court or by the two coordinate branches of government. See, e.g., Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 209 (1972) (finding statute clearly granted standing to private plaintiffs asserting housing discrimination claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Supreme Court Doctrine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has never recognized parens patriae standing in a foreign nation where only quasi-sovereign interests are at stake. The justifications offered to support parens patriae standing in the individual States of the Union are not applicable here. Further, several doctrines of judicial restraint counsel against recognition of such standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Standing of foreign nations to bring suit in the federal courts has been recognized in cases in which the foreign nation has suffered a direct injury. \"There is no question but that foreign States may sue private parties in the federal courts.\" Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 323 n.2 (1934). That standing has been conditioned on the requirement that the foreign nation satisfy the usual standing requirements imposed on individuals or domestic corporations. The Supreme Court \"has long recognized the rule that a foreign nation is generally entitled to prosecute any civil claim in the courts of the United States upon the same basis as a domestic corporation or individual might do.\" Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308, 318-19 (1978). For example, foreign nations may bring treble damages antitrust claims under the Clayton Act to address their direct injuries. Id. at 319.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no argument made here that Mexico could meet normal standing requirements applied to individuals or domestic corporations. Indeed, there is some danger that Mexico \"advances abstract questions of wide public significance essentially amounting to generalized grievances more appropriately addressed to the representative branches.\" Benjamin v. Aroostock Med. Ctr., Inc., 57 F.3d 101, 104 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mexico's argument is based on the Supreme Court's recognition of standing in the States of the Union under the parens patriae doctrine. By analogy, Mexico says, it should be treated in like manner. Such an analogy is not implausible; indeed, in granting parens patriae standing to the States, the Supreme Court has analogized the States to foreign nations. See Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U.S. 208, 241 (1901). But the analogy is incomplete, and so the elegant symmetry of Mexico's argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary justification for recognizing parens patriae standing in the States, repeated throughout a century's Supreme Court caselaw, derives from important principles underlying our federal system. First, the States have surrendered certain aspects of their sovereignty to the federal government and, in return, are given recourse to solve their problems with other States. In Missouri v. Illinois, supra, the Court recognized parens patriae standing in the State of Missouri to sue the State of Illinois for sending sewage into the Mississippi River that poisoned its drinking water, endangered the health of its residents, and impaired the commercial value of its towns and cities. See Missouri, 180 U.S. at 241. The Court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Missouri were an independent and sovereign State all must admit that she could seek a remedy by negotiation, and, that failing, by force. Diplomatic powers and the right to make war having been surrendered to the general government, it was to be expected that upon the latter would be devolved the duty of providing a remedy....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 241; see generally Ann Woolhandler &amp; Michael G. Collins, State Standing, 81 Va. L. Rev. 387, 446-47 (1995) (around the turn of twentieth century, the Court \"began allowing states to vindicate in federal court their general interest in protecting their citizens\" through interstate pollution actions to enjoin public nuisances). Second, States require a sufficiently independent forum to resolve their disputes with one another. Accordingly, under Article III of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over actions between two or more States. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a); see also Georgia v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 450 (1945) (\"The original jurisdiction of this Court is one of the mighty instruments which the framers of the Constitution provided so that adequate machinery might be available for the peaceful settlement of disputes between States and between a State and citizens of another State.\"); see generally Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction &#167; 10.3.1, at 580 (2d ed. 1994) (\"Without a tribunal to resolve their differences, states might resort to armed conflicts with one another or other forms of coercive behavior.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Indeed, the Court's expansion of parens patriae doctrine beyond its traditional common law parameters took place in cases involving the Court's exercise of its original jurisdiction to decide controversies between States or between a State and a citizen of another State -- an area in which the Court acted as an arbiter between quasi-sovereign interests. See Curtis, The Checkered Career of Parens Patriae, 25 DePaul L. Rev. at 908. For obvious reasons, neither of these two federalism justifications applies here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mexico stresses that it has sued private parties, not a State, as defendants, and turns for support to a subcategory of cases in which the Supreme Court has recognized parens patriae standing in States to sue private companies, not other States. That aspect of the doctrine originated in Tennessee Copper Co., supra. There Georgia was permitted to sue for injunctive relief against defendant copper companies that allegedly discharged noxious gasses over Georgia. Again, the Court rested its extension of the doctrine on federalism grounds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the states by their union made the forcible abatement of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to submit to whatever might be done. They did not renounce the possibility of making reasonable demands on the ground of their still remaining quasi-sovereign interests; and the alternative to force is a suit in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">206 U.S. at 237.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> While Mexico is correct to concede that it would face additional problems if this suit had been brought against a State, this does not alter the fact that the federalism justifications for permitting States to bring suit parens patriae against private entities are simply absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, Mexico says that under Snapp, a more recent case, its standing must be recognized. Snapp involved Puerto Rico's participation in the Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 49 et seq., which had mandated the establishment of a nationwide employment system and encouraged the States to participate in that system if authorized by the Secretary of Labor. See Snapp, 458 U.S. at 594-95. Puerto Rico was included in the Act's definition of a State. See id. at 594 n.1. If unemployed persons capable of performing the labor sought could not be found in this country, then temporary foreign workers could be brought in. See id. at 595. Thus, the Act gave a preference to United States workers (including citizens of Puerto Rico) for newly available jobs in this country and prevented such workers from being disadvantaged by foreign workers. See id. at 596. Puerto Rico certified more than a thousand of its workers to Virginia apple growers looking for temporary labor during the 1978 harvest season. When Virginia growers refused to hire Puerto Rican workers, including those who had already arrived in Virginia, Puerto Rico sued for declaratory and injunctive relief. See id. at 596-97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court recognized parens patriae standing in Puerto Rico. Id. at 608. Although the Court recognized Puerto Rico's interest in avoiding discrimination against its citizens as a quasi-sovereign interest, it did so in the context of describing Puerto Rico's role in the federal system. See id. at 607-08 (\"Distinct from but related to the general well-being of its residents, the State has an interest in securing observance of the terms under which it participates in the federal system.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Snapp Court granted standing to Puerto Rico qua State under the Wagner-Peyser Act on two alternative grounds: 1) a State's interest in protecting citizens from discrimination, id. at 609; and 2) a State's interest in equal participation in a federal employment service scheme, id. at 609-10. Here, of course, Mexico relies only on the former ground. While Snapp's discussion of federalism principles --e.g., its discussion of a State's right to the observance of the terms of a compact by which it participates in the federal system, id. at 607-08 -- seems to refer distinctly to the second of the two grounds of standing, and thus the one not relied on here by Mexico, the two grounds dovetail in that residents were being excluded from participation in a federal program by virtue of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not read Snapp as establishing parens patriae standing in a State in the absence of federalism concerns where the quasi-sovereign interest at stake is the prevention of discrimination against that State's citizens. Indeed, it remains questionable whether Snapp would permit a State to seek parens patriae standing on the basis Mexico asserts here because States are not assigned a special role in the enforcement of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981, unlike the special role they are assigned under the Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 49 et seq., which was at issue in Snapp. But even if States could bring suits such as this one, Mexico's claim would still fail. By definition, a foreign nation has no cognizable interests in our system of federalism. And such interests are a critical element of parens patriae standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is Mexico's position supported by adherence to any principle of customary international law. Such a principle would provide an arguable basis on which to grant standing. Mexico, however, has admitted that it knows of no such principle recognizing parens patriae standing in foreign nations and we likewise have found none.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Instead, Mexico points hopefully to the principle of comity. The principle is well recognized but beside the point. Comity permits foreign nations to sue in our courts if they meet the normal standing requirements imposed on individuals. See Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1964). But parens patriae standing goes beyond normal standing requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the granting of parens patriae status to foreign nations would raise concerns beyond the lack of support for such status in precedent or prior reasoning. One particularly compelling concern was thoughtfully articulated by the district court. The conduct of the foreign affairs of this country is committed to the Executive and to the Congress. This division of power should give courts pause before entering this arena, absent guidance from those other two branches. Care should be taken not to impinge on the Executive's treaty-making prerogatives or to assume that courts have the institutional competence to perform functions assigned elsewhere by the Constitution. See United States v. Kin-Hong, 110 F.3d 103, 110-11 (1st Cir.), stay denied, 520 U.S. 1206 (1997). The Executive often requires, before extending rights to foreign nations, that there be agreements providing for reciprocal protection of American interests. The ability of the other branches to secure such reciprocity could be undermined if the Judiciary did not adhere to the principal of non-interference. See United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 587-88 (1st Cir.) (reciting dangers of this country's penal enforcement of other countries' customs and tax laws without reciprocal enforcement of American laws), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 905 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mexico says that these concerns are alleviated by the act of state doctrine and the political question doctrine. It is difficult to see what the act of state doctrine, which has traditionally precluded review by United States courts of official acts by foreign states, see Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 303-04 (1918), has to do with the situation here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> And while there is some parallel to the political question doctrine, it works against Mexico. Again, the very question of whether a foreign nation should be given rights to sue beyond those rights enjoyed by United States citizens raises concerns about the allocation of responsibility among our three branches of government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, other reasons for caution stem from the rules and procedures within the federal judiciary. As the Eighth Circuit noted in denying parens patriae status to foreign governments in a Sherman Act case, class actions are often the preferable vehicle to pursue claims on behalf of a country's citizens. See Pfizer, Inc. v. Lord, 522 F.2d 612, 617-18 (8th Cir. 1975) (\"th[e] strong preference for class actions over Parens patriae has been repeatedly expressed\"), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 950 (1976). Furthermore, the potential exists for conflicts between the individual litigants and the parens patriae nation plaintiff over issues of settlement, appropriate relief, and the like. See Lisa Moscati Hawkes, Note, Parens Patriae and the Union Carbide Case: The Disaster at Bhopal Continues, 21 Cornell Int'l L.J. 181, 181-83 (1988) (discussing case brought by government of India under the parens patriae doctrine in which India blocked settlement offer that individual plaintiffs had wanted to accept). But see Comment, Parens Patriae Representation in Transnational Crises: The Bhopal Tragedy, 17 Cal. W. Int'l L.J. 175, 184 (1987) (suggesting that unusual circumstances surrounding Bhopal case made it ideal for application of parens patriae doctrine). Indeed, relief obtained by the parens patriae plaintiff may bar private litigants from later bringing suit. See City of Tacoma v. Taxpayers of Tacoma, 357 U.S. 320, 334 (1958). Commentators have also suggested that, even as to individual States, parens patriae standing should be limited because \"expansive state standing has a serious potential to undermine rather than complement individual standing in constitutional cases.\" Woolhandler &amp; Collins, State Standing, 81 Va. L. Rev. at 396.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mexico says that there is no potential for conflict because it seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief whereas the individual plaintiffs seek primarily monetary compensation. In fact, the individual plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief, particularly on behalf of the putative class. See Ramirez, 194 F.R.D. at 352 (plaintiffs' seek to enjoin DeCoster \"from maintaining a policy of discrimination against Mexicans regarding the terms and conditions of their employment\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we have looked to Supreme Court precedent and doctrine to see whether there is warrant to extend parens patriae standing to a foreign nation in this action. There is no direct precedent allowing for such status and the federalism concerns that animate recognition of parens patriae status in the States are simply absent. Moreover, there are reasons for the courts not to recognize such standing, reasons stemming from the assignment of the foreign relations powers to the other branches. There are other reasons having to do with prudential considerations within the courts themselves, concerns about avoiding conflict with the class action rules and about undermining the role of the individual plaintiffs. All of these reasons may be overcome should the Supreme Court or other two branches decide these policy concerns differently. But the Supreme Court has not yet done so, and we thus turn to the other two branches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Coordinate Branches</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is left is the question of whether the Executive or the Congress has given any guidance on the issue before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No party contends that Congress took a position on the topic in the definition of the word \"persons\" within the meaning of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981. Nor does Mexico point to a treaty or executive agreement affording it special, parens patriae standing. Further, Mexico points to no statute recognizing such standing. By contrast, Congress has expressly authorized the United States, by its Attorney General, to enforce federal statutes and some Fourteenth Amendment rights. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000a-5 (1994) (authorizing suits for injunctive relief to enforce an individual's right to equal enjoyment of public accommodations); id. &#167; 2000e-5 (authorizing suits for injunctive relief from discriminatory employment practices); cf. Larry W. Yackle, A Worthy Champion for Fourteenth Amendment Rights: The United States in Parens Patriae, 92 Nw. U. L. Rev. 111, 114 (1997) (advocating parens patriae suits by the United States to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the contrary, the defendants say, Congress and the President have indicated that disputes such as these are not to be heard by the courts but are instead to be governed by the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") and, more specifically, by the so-called labor \"side agreement.\" See North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, Sept. 8, 9, 12, and 14, 1993, 32 I.L.M. 1499 (1993) (\"NAALC\"). Since NAFTA and NAALC govern this conflict, defendants say that these agreements provide Mexico's exclusive remedy and preclude resort to the federal courts. The NAALC establishes four levels for settling labor law disputes, including top-level consultation between national labor law ministers of the respective member States. See id. art. 22, 32 I.L.M. at 1508.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Such consultation extends to any labor law matter within the scope of the Agreement, see id., including the elimination of employment discrimination, see id. Annex 1, &#182; 7, 32 I.L.M. at 1515-16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> If the parties are unable to resolve the matter by cooperation, NAALC provides for dispute resolution through binding arbitration. Id. arts. 27-41, 32 I.L.M. at 1509-13. Mexico rejoins that while NAFTA covers disputes between governments, such as a claim by Mexico that the United States is not enforcing its own labor laws, this action involves discrimination claims against a private party. While Mexico's argument is not without force, resolution of this precise issue is not necessary. The important point is that there is no suggestion in NAFTA or NAALC that the other two branches of the United States government intended to grant Mexico special standing as parens patriae to pursue these claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court commendably invited comment from the U.S. Department of State. The State Department, however, declined to comment, and thus, again, there is no indication of support by the Executive Branch for Mexico's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mexico's final arguments, which are based in policy, are not insignificant. More than one thousand workers of Mexican descent worked at DeCoster between 1992 and 1996. Many of these transitory workers are poor, are isolated both geographically and culturally, are economically dependent on their employer, and are in a poor position to obtain legal services or to work with counsel. Amicus Farmworker Justice Fund, Inc. also points to decreased efforts by federal agencies charged with enforcing wage and hour laws in agriculture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Mexico, however, is not left powerless to address these concerns. As the district court suggested, Mexico could financially support the plaintiffs in their efforts or seek to participate as amicus. Moreover, the alleged violations may be entirely appropriate for Mexico to raise with the United States though diplomatic channels. But the courts, absent the type of clear direction discussed earlier, are not the appropriate forum for the litigation of Mexico's quasi-sovereign interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of dismissal as to Mexico as a party plaintiff is affirmed.

Rev. 895, 898 (1976) (\"[p]arens patriae was [originally] limited to a parental concern for dependent classes\"). While American courts adopted this common-law concept, they did so -- consistent with the notion of legislative supremacy -- in the form of a legislative prerogative that was \"to be exercised [by States] in the interests of humanity, and for the prevention of injury to those who cannot protect themselves.\" Snapp, 458 U.S. at 600 (quoting Mormon Church v. United States, 136 U.S. 1, 57 (1890)). The Supreme Court expanded the doctrine by determining that an individual State could sue under parens patriae on behalf of all of its citizens. See Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. at 257-58 (citing Louisiana v. Texas, 176 U.S. 1 (1900), as signaling the beginning of this trend).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  The antitrust field has its own rules. Even a State of the Union may not bring such actions in a parens patriae capacity claiming general injury to its economy because it has not, in that capacity, suffered an injury to its business or property within the meaning of &#167; 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 15. See Kansas v.

Indeed, the Court has noted that even the creation of the new procedural device of parens patriae actions by States on behalf of their citizens to enforce existing rights of recovery under &#167; 4 of the Clayton Act, see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 15c(a)(1), \"'creates no new substantive liability'...

The doctrine has developed as to States of the United States. It creates an exception to normal rules of standing applied to private citizens in recognition of the special role that a State plays in pursuing its quasi-sovereign interests in \"the well-being of its populace.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110789\"><a href=\"/opinion/110789/alfred-l-snapp-son-inc-v-puerto-rico-ex-rel-barez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 602; </a></span>see also Georgia v.

The most complete explanation of the parens patriae doctrine in its modern incarnation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> as applied to the States of this country, appears in the Supreme Court's opinion in Snapp:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to maintain [a parens patriae] action, the State must articulate an interest apart from the interests of particular private parties, i.e., the State must be more than a nominal party. The State must express a quasi-sovereign interest. Although the articulation of such interests is a matter for case-by-case development -- neither an exhaustive formal definition nor a definitive list of qualifying interests can be presented in the abstract -- certain characteristics of such interests are so far evident. These characteristics fall into two general categories. First, a State has a quasi-sovereign interest in the health and well-being -- both physical and economic -- of its residents in general. Second, a State has a quasi-sovereign interest in not being discriminatorily denied its rightful status within the federal system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">458 U.S. at 607. Mexico stakes its claim in our case on this first type of quasi-sovereign interest, i.e., its interest in the general health and well-being of workers of Mexican descent employed by defendants. We do not reach the issue of whether there is a quasi-sovereign interest here, but simply assume that Mexico has interests apart from those of the individual plaintiffs and is more than a nominal party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question here presented is whether a foreign nation which asserts only quasi-sovereign interests and not its own proprietary or sovereign interests should be afforded standing as parens patriae. We consider this to be a question of prudential standing, and not an Article III question. See, e.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 471 (1982). Our answer is that parens patriae standing should not be recognized in a foreign nation unless there is a clear indication of intent to grant such standing expressed by the Supreme Court or by the two coordinate branches of government. See, e.g., Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108640\"><a href=\"/opinion/108640/trafficante-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 209 (1972) (finding statute clearly granted standing to private plaintiffs asserting housing discrimination claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Supreme Court Doctrine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has never recognized parens patriae standing in a foreign nation where only quasi-sovereign interests are at stake. The justifications offered to support parens patriae standing in the individual States of the Union are not applicable here. Further, several doctrines of judicial restraint counsel against recognition of such standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Standing of foreign nations to bring suit in the federal courts has been recognized in cases in which the foreign nation has suffered a direct injury. \"There is no question but that foreign States may sue private parties in the federal courts.\" Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102271\"><a href=\"/opinion/102271/principality-of-monaco-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 323 n.2 (1934). That standing has been conditioned on the requirement that the foreign nation satisfy the usual standing requirements imposed on individuals or domestic corporations. The Supreme Court \"has long recognized the rule that a foreign nation is generally entitled to prosecute any civil claim in the courts of the United States upon the same basis as a domestic corporation or individual might do.\" Pfizer, Inc. v.

By analogy, Mexico says, it should be treated in like manner. Such an analogy is not implausible; indeed, in granting parens patriae standing to the States, the Supreme Court has analogized the States to foreign nations. See Missouri v. Illinois, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></span>, 241 (1901).

First, the States have surrendered certain aspects of their sovereignty to the federal government and, in return, are given recourse to solve their problems with other States. In Missouri v. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Illinois,</span> supra</span>, the Court recognized parens patriae standing in the State of Missouri to sue the State of Illinois for sending sewage into the Mississippi River that poisoned its drinking water, endangered the health of its residents, and impaired the commercial value of its towns and cities. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Missouri,</span> <span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">241</span></span>. The Court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Missouri were an independent and sovereign State all must admit that she could seek a remedy by negotiation, and, that failing, by force. Diplomatic powers and the right to make war having been surrendered to the general government, it was to be expected that upon the latter would be devolved the duty of providing a remedy....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 241; </span>see generally Ann Woolhandler &amp; Michael G.

Rev. 387, 446-47 (1995) (around the turn of twentieth century, the Court \"began allowing states to vindicate in federal court their general interest in protecting their citizens\" through interstate pollution actions to enjoin public nuisances). Second, States require a sufficiently independent forum to resolve their disputes with one another. Accordingly, under Article III of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over actions between two or more States. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a); see also Georgia v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104109\"><a href=\"/opinion/104109/georgia-v-pennsylvania-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span>, 450 (1945) (\"The original jurisdiction of this Court is one of the mighty instruments which the framers of the Constitution provided so that adequate machinery might be available for the peaceful settlement of disputes between States and between a State and citizens of another State.\"); see generally Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction &#167; 10.3.1, at 580 (2d ed. 1994) (\"Without a tribunal to resolve their differences, states might resort to armed conflicts with one another or other forms of coercive behavior.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Indeed, the Court's expansion of parens patriae doctrine beyond its traditional common law parameters took place in cases involving the Court's exercise of its original jurisdiction to decide controversies between States or between a State and a citizen of another State -- an area in which the Court acted as an arbiter between quasi-sovereign interests. See Curtis, The Checkered Career of Parens Patriae, 25 DePaul L. Rev. at 908. For obvious reasons, neither of these two federalism justifications applies here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mexico stresses that it has sued private parties, not a State, as defendants, and turns for support to a subcategory of cases in which the Supreme Court has recognized parens patriae standing in States to sue private companies, not other States. That aspect of the doctrine originated in Tennessee Copper <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>. There Georgia was permitted to sue for injunctive relief against defendant copper companies that allegedly discharged noxious gasses over Georgia. Again, the Court rested its extension of the doctrine on federalism grounds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the states by their union made the forcible abatement of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to submit to whatever might be done. They did not renounce the possibility of making reasonable demands on the ground of their still remaining quasi-sovereign interests; and the alternative to force is a suit in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">206 U.S. at 237.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> While Mexico is correct to concede that it would face additional problems if this suit had been brought against a State, this does not alter the fact that the federalism justifications for permitting States to bring suit parens patriae against private entities are simply absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, Mexico says that under Snapp, a more recent case, its standing must be recognized. Snapp involved Puerto Rico's participation in the Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 49 et seq., which had mandated the establishment of a nationwide employment system and encouraged the States to participate in that system if authorized by the Secretary of Labor.

While Snapp's discussion of federalism principles --e.g., its discussion of a State's right to the observance of the terms of a compact by which it participates in the federal system, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110789\"><a href=\"/opinion/110789/alfred-l-snapp-son-inc-v-puerto-rico-ex-rel-barez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 607-08 </a></span>-- seems to refer distinctly to the second of the two grounds of standing, and thus the one not relied on here by Mexico, the two grounds dovetail in that residents were being excluded from participation in a federal program by virtue of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not read Snapp as establishing parens patriae standing in a State in the absence of federalism concerns where the quasi-sovereign interest at stake is the prevention of discrimination against that State's citizens. Indeed, it remains questionable whether Snapp would permit a State to seek parens patriae standing on the basis Mexico asserts here because States are not assigned a special role in the enforcement of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981, unlike the special role they are assigned under the Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 49 et seq., which was at issue in Snapp. But even if States could bring suits such as this one, Mexico's claim would still fail. By definition, a foreign nation has no cognizable interests in our system of federalism. And such interests are a critical element of parens patriae standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is Mexico's position supported by adherence to any principle of customary international law. Such a principle would provide an arguable basis on which to grant standing. Mexico, however, has admitted that it knows of no such principle recognizing parens patriae standing in foreign nations and we likewise have found none.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Instead, Mexico points hopefully to the principle of comity. The principle is well recognized but beside the point. Comity permits foreign nations to sue in our courts if they meet the normal standing requirements imposed on individuals. See Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106775\"><a href=\"/opinion/106775/banco-nacional-de-cuba-v-sabbatino/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 408-09 (1964). But parens patriae standing goes beyond normal standing requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the granting of parens patriae status to foreign nations would raise concerns beyond the lack of support for such status in precedent or prior reasoning. One particularly compelling concern was thoughtfully articulated by the district court. The conduct of the foreign affairs of this country is committed to the Executive and to the Congress. This division of power should give courts pause before entering this arena, absent guidance from those other two branches. Care should be taken not to impinge on the Executive's treaty-making prerogatives or to assume that courts have the institutional competence to perform functions assigned elsewhere by the Constitution. See United States v. Kin-Hong, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739065\"><a href=\"/opinion/739065/united-states-v-lui-kin-hong-aka-jerry-lui/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 110-11 (1st Cir.), stay denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span> </span>(1997). The Executive often requires, before extending rights to foreign nations, that there be agreements providing for reciprocal protection of American interests. The ability of the other branches to secure such reciprocity could be undermined if the Judiciary did not adhere to the principal of non-interference. See United States v. Boots, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196657\"><a href=\"/opinion/196657/united-states-v-boots/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 587-88 (1st Cir.)

It is difficult to see what the act of state doctrine, which has traditionally precluded review by United States courts of official acts by foreign states, see Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99123\"><a href=\"/opinion/99123/oetjen-v-central-leather-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span>, 303-04 (1918), has to do with the situation here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> And while there is some parallel to the political question doctrine, it works against Mexico. Again, the very question of whether a foreign nation should be given rights to sue beyond those rights enjoyed by United States citizens raises concerns about the allocation of responsibility among our three branches of government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, other reasons for caution stem from the rules and procedures within the federal judiciary. As the Eighth Circuit noted in denying parens patriae status to foreign governments in a Sherman Act case, class actions are often the preferable vehicle to pursue claims on behalf of a country's citizens. See Pfizer, Inc. v. Lord, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"330022\"><a href=\"/opinion/330022/pfizer-inc-v-honorable-miles-w-lord-united-states-district-judge-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 617-18 (8th Cir. 1975) (\"th[e] strong preference for class actions over Parens patriae has been repeatedly expressed\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span> </span>(1976). Furthermore, the potential exists for conflicts between the individual litigants and the parens patriae nation plaintiff over issues of settlement, appropriate relief, and the like. See Lisa Moscati Hawkes, Note, Parens Patriae and the Union Carbide Case: The Disaster at Bhopal Continues, 21 Cornell Int'l L.J. 181, 181-83 (1988) (discussing case brought by government of India under the parens patriae doctrine in which India blocked settlement offer that individual plaintiffs had wanted to accept). But see Comment, Parens Patriae Representation in Transnational Crises: The Bhopal Tragedy, 17 Cal. W. Int'l L.J. 175, 184 (1987) (suggesting that unusual circumstances surrounding Bhopal case made it ideal for application of parens patriae doctrine). Indeed, relief obtained by the parens patriae plaintiff may bar private litigants from later bringing suit. See City of Tacoma v. Taxpayers of Tacoma, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105732\"><a href=\"/opinion/105732/tacoma-v-taxpayers-of-tacoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span>, 334 (1958). Commentators have also suggested that, even as to individual States, parens patriae standing should be limited because \"expansive state standing has a serious potential to undermine rather than complement individual standing in constitutional cases.\" Woolhandler &amp; Collins, State Standing, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span>. Rev. at 396.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mexico says that there is no potential for conflict because it seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief whereas the individual plaintiffs seek primarily monetary compensation. In fact, the individual plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief, particularly on behalf of the putative class. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ramirez,</span> <span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> at <span class=\"page\">352</span> </span>(plaintiffs' seek to enjoin DeCoster \"from maintaining a policy of discrimination against Mexicans regarding the terms and conditions of their employment\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we have looked to Supreme Court precedent and doctrine to see whether there is warrant to extend parens patriae standing to a foreign nation in this action. There is no direct precedent allowing for such status and the federalism concerns that animate recognition of parens patriae status in the States are simply absent. Moreover, there are reasons for the courts not to recognize such standing, reasons stemming from the assignment of the foreign relations powers to the other branches. There are other reasons having to do with prudential considerations within the courts themselves, concerns about avoiding conflict with the class action rules and about undermining the role of the individual plaintiffs. All of these reasons may be overcome should the Supreme Court or other two branches decide these policy concerns differently. But the Supreme Court has not yet done so, and we thus turn to the other two branches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Coordinate Branches</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is left is the question of whether the Executive or the Congress has given any guidance on the issue before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No party contends that Congress took a position on the topic in the definition of the word \"persons\" within the meaning of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981. Nor does Mexico point to a treaty or executive agreement affording it special, parens patriae standing. Further, Mexico points to no statute recognizing such standing. By contrast, Congress has expressly authorized the United States, by its Attorney General, to enforce federal statutes and some Fourteenth Amendment rights. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000a-5 (1994) (authorizing suits for injunctive relief to enforce an individual's right to equal enjoyment of public accommodations); id. &#167; 2000e-5 (authorizing suits for injunctive relief from discriminatory employment practices); cf. Larry W. Yackle, A Worthy Champion for Fourteenth Amendment Rights: The United States in Parens Patriae, 92 Nw. U. L. Rev. 111, 114 (1997) (advocating parens patriae suits by the United States to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the contrary, the defendants say, Congress and the President have indicated that disputes such as these are not to be heard by the courts but are instead to be governed by the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") and, more specifically, by the so-called labor \"side agreement.\" See North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, Sept. 8, 9, 12, and 14, 1993, 32 I.L.M. 1499 (1993) (\"NAALC\"). Since NAFTA and NAALC govern this conflict, defendants say that these agreements provide Mexico's exclusive remedy and preclude resort to the federal courts. The NAALC establishes four levels for settling labor law disputes, including top-level consultation between national labor law ministers of the respective member States. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> art. 22, </span>32 I.L.M. at 1508.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Such consultation extends to any labor law matter within the scope of the Agreement, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> including the </span>elimination of employment discrimination, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Annex 1, </span>&#182; 7, 32 I.L.M. at 1515-16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> If the parties are unable to resolve the matter by cooperation, NAALC provides for dispute resolution through binding arbitration. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> arts. 27-41, </span>32 I.L.M. at 1509-13. Mexico rejoins that while NAFTA covers disputes between governments, such as a claim by Mexico that the United States is not enforcing its own labor laws, this action involves discrimination claims against a private party. While Mexico's argument is not without force, resolution of this precise issue is not necessary. The important point is that there is no suggestion in NAFTA or NAALC that the other two branches of the United States government intended to grant Mexico special standing as parens patriae to pursue these claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court commendably invited comment from the U.S. Department of State. The State Department, however, declined to comment, and thus, again, there is no indication of support by the Executive Branch for Mexico's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mexico's final arguments, which are based in policy, are not insignificant. More than one thousand workers of Mexican descent worked at DeCoster between 1992 and 1996. Many of these transitory workers are poor, are isolated both geographically and culturally, are economically dependent on their employer, and are in a poor position to obtain legal services or to work with counsel. Amicus Farmworker Justice Fund, Inc. also points to decreased efforts by federal agencies charged with enforcing wage and hour laws in agriculture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Mexico, however, is not left powerless to address these concerns. As the district court suggested, Mexico could financially support the plaintiffs in their efforts or seek to participate as amicus. Moreover, the alleged violations may be entirely appropriate for Mexico to raise with the United States though diplomatic channels. But the courts, absent the type of clear direction discussed earlier, are not the appropriate forum for the litigation of Mexico's quasi-sovereign interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of dismissal as to Mexico as a party plaintiff is affirmed.
