Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n               Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                   Circuit Judges.\r\n\nMelba N.

Lewis, Assistant Regional\r\nCounsel, Social Security Administration, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 29, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  After carefully reviewing the briefs and the\r\nadministrative record, we affirm the decision of the Commissioner\r\nof Social Security that claimant Victor Garcia was not entitled to\r\nSocial Security disability benefits.  We do so essentially for the\r\nreasons stated in the district court's Opinion and Order, dated\r\nJanuary 29, 1999.  The only comment we add is that this is a case\r\nin which there are conflicting medical reports in the record and\r\nwe cannot say that the Commissioner's decision not to credit the\r\nreports of claimant's treating physicians was unreasonable.  See\r\nRodriguez Pagan v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 819 F.2d\r\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam).  As almost always is the case,\r\nsuch conflicts are for the Commissioner, not the courts.  Rodriguez\r\nv. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st\r\nCir. 1981).\r\nAffirmed.\n",
