Josefina Rubert-Torres\n\nappeals from the district court's summary judgment in favor of one\n\ndefendant and from the judgment entered upon a jury verdict for the\n\nother defendant. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1332, and we have jurisdiction over Rubert-Torres' timely\n\nappeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Rubert-Torres brought this medical malpractice action on\n\nbehalf of her daughter Kimayra Cintrón-Rubert, a 21 year-old woman with\n\ncerebral palsy, against Dr. Néstor Rivera-Cotté, the doctor who\n\ndelivered Kimayra, and Hospital San Pablo (Hospital), where Kimayra was\n\nborn. Before trial, the district court entered summary judgment for\n\nthe Hospital.   At trial, Rubert-Torres' theory, supported by an\n\nobstetrical/gynecological (OB/GYN) expert and a neurological expert,\n\nwas that physician error during her pregnancy and delivery of Kimayra\n\ncaused Kimayra's disabilities. Dr. Rivera-Cotté's theory, supported by\n\nhis own OB/GYN, neurological, and genetics experts, was that Kimayra's\n\ndisabilities arose genetically. The jury returned a verdict for Dr.\n\nRivera-Cotté.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Rubert-Torres first contends that the district court erred\n\nin entering summary judgment sua sponte in favor of the Hospital. This\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fargument is slightly misworded. The district court did not enter\n\nsummary judgment sua sponte; rather, it converted the Hospital's motion\n\nfor judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(c), into a motion for summary judgment because Rubert-\n\nTorres attached an expert witness report to her opposition to the\n\nmotion to dismiss. We review whether the district court properly\n\nconverted a Rule 12 motion into a motion for summary judgment for abuse\n\nof discretion. See Whiting v. Maiolini, 921 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nSignificantly, Rubert-Torres only makes this procedural argument\n\nagainst the entry of summary judgment; she does not contest the merits\n\nof the district court's decision.\n\n          We first recite the relevant facts. Rubert-Torres filed the\n\ncomplaint on July 14, 1996; the Hospital answered on October 7, 1996.\n\nDiscovery started, and two scheduling conferences were held, with all\n\nparties represented, on November 26, 1996, and on April 30, 1997. At\n\nthe second conference, the Hospital requested that Rubert-Torres\n\nsupport her allegations against it with specific facts, which she\n\nfailed to do. At that point, discovery was apparently well underway:\n\nRubert-Torres had received four expert witness reports and 20 years of\n\nmedical records, interrogatories had been filed, and depositions taken.\n\n          When Rubert-Torres failed to support her allegations against\n\nthe Hospital with specific facts, the Hospital filed a motion on May 7,\n\n1997, for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fProcedure 12(c). Rubert-Torres filed an opposition to the motion on\n\nMay 14, 1997, including with it an expert witness report derived from\n\ndiscovery. On August 15, 1997, the district court, without previously\n\nproviding notice, converted the motion for judgment on the pleadings\n\ninto a motion for summary judgment, relied on the expert report, and\n\nentered an order for summary judgment in favor of the Hospital.\n\n          Rule 12(c) provides, in part:\n\n          If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,\n          matters outside the pleadings are presented to\n          and not excluded by the court, the motion shall\n          be treated as one for summary judgment and\n          disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all\n          parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to\n          present all material made pertinent to such a\n          motion by Rule 56.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). In this regard, the rule is identical to Rule\n\n12(b)(6), see Collier v. City of Chicopee, 158 F.3d 601, 603 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), and relevant Rule 12(b)(6) case law on conversion assists this\n\nRule 12(c) conversion case.\n\n          Conversion of a motion for judgment on the pleadings into one\n\nfor summary judgment should only occur after the parties have been\n\noffered a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present pertinent summary\n\njudgment materials. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Whether the parties had an\n\n\"opportunity to respond necessarily turns on the way in which the\n\nparticular case under consideration has unfolded.\" See Whiting, 921\n\nF.2d at 6. Thus, we have disfavored conversion when (1) the motion\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fcomes quickly after the complaint was filed, (2) discovery is in its\n\ninfancy and the nonmovant is limited in obtaining and submitting\n\nevidence to counter the motion, or (3) the nonmovant does not have\n\nreasonable notice that a conversion might occur.        See id. at 7.\n\n          In this case, however, these considerations are not present.\n\nThe Rule 12(c) motion came 10 months after the complaint -- and\n\nsubsequent to the Hospital's request that Rubert-Torres support her\n\nallegations. There had been substantial discovery. Finally, Rubert-\n\nTorres was on constructive notice that conversion could occur.\n\nExplicit notice is not required. See Collier, 158 F.3d at 603; C.B.\n\nTrucking, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 137 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n1998). Rubert-Torres had constructive notice because she presented the\n\ndistrict court with additional materials in her opposition memorandum.\n\nAs we recently held, \"a party receives constructive notice that the\n\ncourt has been afforded the option of conversion . . . when . . . the\n\nnon-movant appends . . . materials [outside the pleadings] to [an]\n\nopposition and urges the court's consideration of them.\" Collier, 158\n\nF.3d at 603. When a plaintiff incorporates materials outside the\n\npleadings into an opposition to a Rule 12(c) motion, the plaintiff\n\n\"implicitly invite[s] conversion -- and a party who invites conversion\n\nscarcely can be heard to complain when the trial court accepts the\n\ninvitation.\" Id.; see also Maruho Co., Ltd. v. Miles, Inc., 13 F.3d 6,\n\n8 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding conversion proper when plaintiff presented\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\finformation outside the pleadings to the district court in opposition\n\nto a motion to dismiss).\n\n          Rubert-Torres argues that she did not invite the district\n\ncourt to convert the Rule 12(c) motion into a summary judgment motion\n\nbecause the attaching of the expert report was for the limited purpose\n\nof indicating \"that further details regarding her claim against\n\nHospital San Pablo had been provided in discovery.\" Her assertion is\n\na stretch.    In her response to the Hospital's Rule 12(c) motion,\n\nRubert-Torres stated that the contentions in the motion were \"more\n\nproperly framed as a motion for a more definite statement under Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(e),\" and that to \"the extent that Hospital\n\nSan Pablo's motion is in effect a 12(e) motion, it has been mooted by\n\nthe provided report of plaintiff's obstetrical expert, Dr. Bernard\n\nNathanson.\"      However,   Rubert-Torres    not   only   relied   upon\n\nDr. Nathanson's report for the limited purpose of refuting the\n\nHospital's motion, to the extent that it was a 12(e) motion, she also\n\nused it to argue the merits of the Rule 12(c) motion, stating: \"The\n\ndepartures from the applicable standard of care identified by Dr.\n\nNathanson show that Hospital San Pablo failed to comply with its legal\n\nduties under Puerto Rico law.\" This statement directly responded to\n\nthe Hospital's contention that, pursuant to applicable law, it was not\n\nliable for Kimayra's condition, and implicitly invited the district\n\ncourt to consider the expert report for Rule 12(c) purposes.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          It is true, as Rubert-Torres argues, that not every\n\nattachment to a Rule 12(c) motion or opposition thereto requires\n\nconversion into a motion for summary judgment. See Beddall v. State\n\nStreet Bank and Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998); Watterson\n\nv. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993). However, in this situation,\n\nRubert-Torres invited the district court to consider Dr. Nathanson's\n\nreport in its ruling on the merits of the Rule 12(c) motion, and thus\n\ninvited the court to convert the Rule 12(c) motion into one for summary\n\njudgment. See Collier, 158 F.3d at 603; Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion when it accepted that\n\ninvitation.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          Rubert-Torres also raises numerous arguments in favor of a\n\nnew trial against Dr. Rivera-Cotté. We address two of those arguments\n\n-- that Kimayra was improperly excluded from the courthouse, and that\n\nshe should have been allowed to appear for a physical demonstration\n\nduring questioning of an expert witness.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          Kimayra was present on the first day of trial and was briefly\n\nintroduced to the pool of potential jurors before jury selection. Her\n\nattorney explained to the potential jurors that \"she will not be with\n\nus in the trial for obvious reasons for a lot of the trial, but she is\n\nentitled to be here.\" He also explained that she would not be present\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fduring jury selection because she \"was getting a little restless\" at\n\nthe time and they did not want her \"to disrupt the proceedings.\"\n\n          Shortly thereafter, the district court banned Kimayra from\n\nthe courtroom during opening statements. The record reflects that her\n\nattorneys did not request, and the district court did not offer, a\n\nreason for the decision. Then, apparently off the record in chambers,\n\nthe district court banned Kimayra not only from the courtroom, but from\n\nthe entire courthouse for the duration of trial.\n\n          Dr. Allan Hausknecht, a neurologist, testified for Rubert-\n\nTorres. He stated that one possible cause of Kimayra's cerebral palsy\n\nwas a genetic factor; that there were about 20 or 30 different physical\n\ncharacteristics that might show that Kimayra had genetic abnormalities;\n\nthat he physically examined her and looked for those characteristics in\n\nher; and that he concluded, based upon her appearance, that her\n\ncerebral palsy was not the result of a genetic abnormality. He stated\n\nthat he could demonstrate this if Kimayra were present -- otherwise it\n\nwould be hard to do so. Rubert-Torres asked the district court to\n\nallow Kimayra into the courtroom briefly so that Dr. Hausknecht could\n\nphysically show the jury that Kimayra did not exhibit those\n\ncharacteristics. The defense objected to Kimayra's presence in the\n\ncourtroom, and the district court, without explanation, sustained the\n\nobjection. Rubert-Torres's attorney attempted to continue asserting\n\nhis position, and the district court cut him off, saying \"I said the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fobjection is sustained.\" Shortly thereafter, out of the presence of\n\nthe jury, Rubert-Torres's attorney asked for reconsideration:\n\n            If I had -- if I -- Your Honor, before I move\n          into another area of the testimony, I just want\n          to reiterate that I think his merely verbal\n          testimony rather goes to characteristics that he\n          saw in Kimayra. To rule on the genetics problem,\n          is an extremely -- actually demonstrating those\n          with the girl, and I don't see any undue\n          prejudice in that.\n\n            After all, she is the plaintiff, and it is the\n          best way of making the testimony very clear, and\n          you know it's clearly probative. To the extent\n          that it might be prejudicial because the girl is\n          pitiful-looking, quite frankly -- but it's very\n          important to show that it's not a genetic\n          problem. That's the issue of this case.\n\n            And to the extent that we are not going to be\n          able to do that, I wanted to preserve my\n          objection for the record and actually to ask for\n          reconsideration of your decision.\n\n\nThe district court denied reconsideration without explanation, but\n\nassured Rubert-Torres's attorney that his objection was \"preserved for\n\nthe record.\"\n\n          Later in the trial, Dr. Rivera-Cotté's pediatric neurological\n\nexpert, Dr. Jesús Vélez-Borrás, also discussed the importance of\n\nexamining Kimayra's physical appearance to determine whether her\n\ncerebral palsy was genetic in origin. Dr. Vélez-Borrás' testimony\n\ncontradicted that of Dr. Hausknecht:       based upon his physical\n\nexamination of Kimayra, Dr. Vélez-Borrás concluded that her condition\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fwas genetic in nature. Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, a genetics expert who\n\ntestified for Dr. Rivera-Cotté, also partially based his conclusion\n\nthat Kimayra's cerebral palsy was genetic in origin on her physical\n\nappearance.\n\n                                  B.\n\n          Rubert-Torres argues that the district court violated\n\nKimayra's due process rights when it barred Kimayra from the courtroom\n\nand eventually from the courthouse entirely, and that it abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing, without explanation, to allow the neurological\n\ndemonstration requiring Kimayra's presence in the courtroom. There is\n\nno dispute that Rubert-Torres preserved these issues in the district\n\ncourt. We review the district court's decision to exclude Kimayra from\n\nthe courthouse for abuse of discretion.        See González-Marín v.\n\nEquitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 845 F.2d 1140, 1146 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nWe also review evidentiary rulings, such as the district court's\n\ndecision to disallow Kimayra's presence in the courtroom for\n\nevidentiary purposes, for abuse of discretion. See Lynch v. City of\n\nBoston, 180 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                  1.\n\n          We first examine the district court's decision to ban Kimayra\n\nfrom the courthouse. Rubert-Torres relies heavily upon Helminski v.\n\nAyerst Lab., 766 F.2d 208 (6th Cir. 1985), which we cited with approval\n\nin González-Marín, 845 F.2d at 1146. Helminski held that a court may\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f\"exclude the plaintiff or limit [her] presence\" without denying due\n\nprocess, 766 F.2d at 217, if her \"mere presence . . . would render the\n\njury unable to arrive at an unbiased judgment concerning liability,\"\n\nid., and she cannot \"understand the proceedings and aid counsel.\" Id.\n\nat 218; González-Marín, 845 F.2d at 1146 (\"We agree with the ruling of\n\nthe Helminski court that a trial court may decide to bar from the\n\ncourtroom a disabled plaintiff incapable of comprehending judicial\n\nproceedings during the liability phase of a trial in order to prevent\n\nprejudicing the jury.\"). This is so because, in that situation, the\n\ncourt must balance the plaintiff's due process rights with the\n\ndefendant's right to an unbiased jury trial. See Helminski, 766 F.2d\n\nat 217.\n\n          Helminski outlined steps a court could take to determine\n\nwhether the plaintiff could be excluded. In the usual case involving\n\na disabled plaintiff, both parties, before trial, should raise the\n\nissue of prejudice of the jury, and the district court should hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing at which it \"observes the injured party.\" Id. At\n\nthe hearing, the defendant has the burden of persuasion to show that\n\nthe plaintiff should be excluded because his or her \"mere presence will\n\nprejudice the jury.\" Id. Only if the defendant persuades the district\n\ncourt of jury prejudice should the court question whether the plaintiff\n\n\"can comprehend the proceedings and assist counsel in any meaningful\n\nway.\" Id. at 218. A plaintiff may only be excluded from court if both\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fher presence would prejudice the jury and she cannot understand counsel\n\nand assist in the case.     See id.\n\n            In this case, the district court apparently decided to\n\nexclude Kimayra from the courthouse in a meeting with counsel in\n\nchambers after trial had begun. No record of the discussion was made;\n\ntherefore, we cannot know what occurred. There is no record of an\n\nevidentiary hearing. There is no indication whether the district court\n\nconsidered Helminski, even though we stated our approval of it in\n\nGonzález-Marín. The court had observed Kimayra, but did not hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing to determine prejudice of the jury. There is no\n\nrecord that Rivera-Cotté, who sought Kimayra's exclusion at trial, was\n\nrequired by the district court to bring forward evidence that Kimayra's\n\nvery presence would jeopardize his right to an unbiased jury trial.\n\nThe district court did not make findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\non the record as to jury prejudice, or as to the extent to which\n\nKimayra could comprehend and assist counsel at trial. We are thus left\n\nto review the court's decisions in a vacuum, entirely unable to\n\ndetermine the precise reasons why it banned Kimayra from the courtroom\n\nand the courthouse.\n\n            Because of the lack of record, we are hesitant to address\n\nthis important due process issue, especially if there must be a new\n\ntrial on the second issue.    We therefore turn to the evidentiary\n\nquestion.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f                                 2.\n\n          Rubert-Torres contends there was reversible error in the\n\ndistrict court's refusal, after Dr. Rivera-Cotté's objection, to allow\n\nKimayra in the courtroom for the purpose of a physical demonstration\n\nduring Dr. Hausknecht's testimony.     The court neither stated the\n\nevidentiary rule upon which it relied, nor allowed argument on the\n\nobjection, nor made findings concerning the prejudicial versus\n\nprobative effect of the evidence. We can only assume that its decision\n\nwas based upon Federal Rule of Evidence 403, which excludes relevant\n\nevidence because its prejudicial effect is substantially greater than\n\nits probativeness.\n\n          We do not always require explicit findings on a Rule 403\n\ndecision, see Navarro de Cosme v. Hospital Pavía, 922 F.2d 926, 931\n\n(1st Cir. 1991), although they would assist us in our review\n\nobligation. See 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 403.03, at 403-31 to\n\n403-32 (2d ed. 1999) (\"When a trial judge excludes evidence under Rule\n\n403, the judge should make a clear statement of the reason for the\n\nrecord . . . .   [R]easoned explanations are the very essence of\n\njudicial method.\") (internal quotation omitted). In our review, we\n\ngive district courts \"substantial deference\" in Rule 403 decisions.\n\nEspeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., Inc., 43 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nThe question before us is whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in excluding the physical demonstration.\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f          Clearly, the evidence was highly relevant. As has been\n\nexplained, experts for both Rubert-Torres and Dr. Rivera-Cotté relied\n\nupon Kimayra's physical appearance to make expert conclusions. They\n\ndisagreed as to what they saw and the resultant conclusions differed.\n\nWhile those experts were allowed to describe Kimayra's appearance for\n\nthe jury, the \"clearest evidence\" on her physical appearance would have\n\nbeen for the jury to see her, which is usually favored over mere\n\ndescription. 4 Wigmore on Evidence § 1158 (Chadbourn rev. 1972); see\n\nalso id. § 1151; Rich v. Ellerman & Bucknall S.S. Co., 278 F.2d 704,\n\n708 (2d Cir. 1960) (\"Limitation of proof of the nature of the injuries\n\nto a description by a doctor was unduly restrictive.         Autoptic\n\nproference is always proper, unless reasons of policy apply to exclude\n\nit.\"). Additionally, in this case, the evidence was fundamental to the\n\ncentral issue in the case: causation. When proffered evidence relates\n\nto the central issue in a case, it is a difficult matter indeed to show\n\nthat the prejudicial effect of that evidence substantially outweighs\n\nits highly probative nature, as Rule 403 requires. See Espeaignnette,\n\n43 F.3d at 8-9; Swajian v. General Motors Corp., 916 F.2d 31, 34-35\n\n(1st Cir. 1990). We have no findings and no statement to explain the\n\ndistrict court's apparent disregard for this highly probative evidence\n\non the central issue at trial.\n\n          In addition, even assuming the jury view preference was\n\nsomewhat prejudicial, the district court could have used a less\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\frestrictive means to minimize the prejudice than entirely excluding\n\nKimayra from the courtroom.       For instance, the court might have\n\nconsidered limiting the amount of time she would be present before the\n\njury, allowing her to enter and exit the courtroom outside the jury's\n\npresence, and giving limiting instructions -- all of which might\n\nminimize prejudice without requiring exclusion. See González-Marín,\n\n845 F.2d at 1146-47; Helminski, 766 F.2d at 217; 4 Wigmore on Evidence,\n\nsupra § 1158.    Because the Federal Rules of Evidence favor the\n\nadmissibility of evidence, less intrusive measures to minimizing the\n\nprejudicial effect of evidence are preferred to excluding evidence.\n\nSee 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra § 403.02[2][c].\n\n          Finally, we are concerned about the somewhat arbitrary nature\n\nof the district court's Rule 403 ruling. We have reversed other Rule\n\n403 exclusions when, as in this case, the evidentiary question is\n\ncomplex and not self-evident, the district court ruled before allowing\n\na response to the objection, there were no findings on prejudice and\n\nprobativeness, and a \"hair-trigger\" decision was made. See United\n\nStates v. Brooks, 145 F.3d 446, 454-55 (1st Cir. 1998), citing In re\n\nPaoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 916 F.2d 829, 836 (3d Cir. 1990) and United\n\nStates v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          We    conclude   that   this   is   one   of   those   rare   and\n\n\"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\" in which we must \"reverse a\n\ndistrict court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fof probative value and unfair effect.\" Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 5.\n\nWe do not do so lightly, but because of the highly probative nature of\n\nthe jury view of Kimayra, the lack of use of less restrictive means of\n\neliminating the prejudicial effect of the evidence, and the \"arbitrary\n\nmanner in which the judge proceeded [which] furnishes a complementary\n\nreason, powerful in itself,\" Brooks, 145 F.3d at 455, we hold that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in disallowing the demonstrative\n\nevidence.\n\n            Of course, error in this evidentiary ruling does not require\n\nreversal unless it is harmful. \"Our [harmlessness] inquiry is whether\n\nexclusion or admission of the evidence affected plaintiff's substantial\n\nrights. The central question is whether this court can say with fair\n\nassurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\"\n\nLynch, 180 F.3d at 15. On such a central issue as causation, and in\n\nthe absence of specific findings of prejudice, it would be speculation\n\nat best, much less with fair assurance, to say that the jury verdict\n\nwas unaffected by the error.\n\n            AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER\n\nPROCEEDINGS.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f",

The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, and we have jurisdiction over Rubert-Torres' timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres brought this medical malpractice action on behalf of her daughter Kimayra Cintron-Rubert, a 21 year-old woman with cerebral palsy, against Dr. Nestor Rivera-Cotte, the doctor who delivered Kimayra, and Hospital San Pablo (Hospital), where Kimayra was born. Before trial, the district court entered summary judgment for the Hospital. At trial, Rubert-Torres' theory, supported by an obstetrical/gynecological (OB/GYN) expert and a neurological expert, was that physician error during her pregnancy and delivery of Kimayra caused Kimayra's disabilities. Dr. Rivera-Cotte's theory, supported by his own OB/GYN, neurological, and genetics experts, was that Kimayra's disabilities arose genetically. The jury returned a verdict for Dr. Rivera-Cotte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres first contends that the district court erred in entering summary judgment sua sponte in favor of the Hospital. This argument is slightly misworded. The district court did not enter summary judgment sua sponte; rather, it converted the Hospital's motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), into a motion for summary judgment because Rubert-Torres attached an expert witness report to her opposition to the motion to dismiss. We review whether the district court properly converted a Rule 12 motion into a motion for summary judgment for abuse of discretion. See Whiting v. Maiolini, 921 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 1990). Significantly, Rubert-Torres only makes this procedural argument against the entry of summary judgment; she does not contest the merits of the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first recite the relevant facts. Rubert-Torres filed the complaint on July 14, 1996; the Hospital answered on October 7, 1996. Discovery started, and two scheduling conferences were held, with all parties represented, on November 26, 1996, and on April 30, 1997. At the second conference, the Hospital requested that Rubert-Torres support her allegations against it with specific facts, which she failed to do. At that point, discovery was apparently well underway: Rubert-Torres had received four expert witness reports and 20 years of medical records, interrogatories had been filed, and depositions taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Rubert-Torres failed to support her allegations against the Hospital with specific facts, the Hospital filed a motion on May 7, 1997, for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). Rubert-Torres filed an opposition to the motion on May 14, 1997, including with it an expert witness report derived from discovery. On August 15, 1997, the district court, without previously providing notice, converted the motion for judgment on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment, relied on the expert report, and entered an order for summary judgment in favor of the Hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 12(c) provides, in part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). In this regard, the rule is identical to Rule 12(b)(6), see Collier v. City of Chicopee, 158 F.3d 601, 603 (1st Cir. 1998), and relevant Rule 12(b)(6) case law on conversion assists this Rule 12(c) conversion case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversion of a motion for judgment on the pleadings into one for summary judgment should only occur after the parties have been offered a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present pertinent summary judgment materials. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Whether the parties had an \"opportunity to respond necessarily turns on the way in which the particular case under consideration has unfolded.\" See Whiting, 921 F.2d at 6. Thus, we have disfavored conversion when (1) the motion comes quickly after the complaint was filed, (2) discovery is in its infancy and the nonmovant is limited in obtaining and submitting evidence to counter the motion, or (3) the nonmovant does not have reasonable notice that a conversion might occur. See id. at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, these considerations are not present. The Rule 12(c) motion came 10 months after the complaint -- and subsequent to the Hospital's request that Rubert-Torres support her allegations. There had been substantial discovery. Finally, Rubert-Torres was on constructive notice that conversion could occur. Explicit notice is not required. See Collier, 158 F.3d at 603; C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 137 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1998). Rubert-Torres had constructive notice because she presented the district court with additional materials in her opposition memorandum. As we recently held, \"a party receives constructive notice that the court has been afforded the option of conversion . . . when . . . the non-movant appends . . . materials [outside the pleadings] to [an] opposition and urges the court's consideration of them.\" Collier, 158 F.3d at 603. When a plaintiff incorporates materials outside the pleadings into an opposition to a Rule 12(c) motion, the plaintiff \"implicitly invite[s] conversion -- and a party who invites conversion scarcely can be heard to complain when the trial court accepts the invitation.\" Id.; see also Maruho Co., Ltd. v. Miles, Inc., 13 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding conversion proper when plaintiff presented information outside the pleadings to the district court in opposition to a motion to dismiss).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres argues that she did not invite the district court to convert the Rule 12(c) motion into a summary judgment motion because the attaching of the expert report was for the limited purpose of indicating \"that further details regarding her claim against Hospital San Pablo had been provided in discovery.\" Her assertion is a stretch. In her response to the Hospital's Rule 12(c) motion, Rubert-Torres stated that the contentions in the motion were \"more properly framed as a motion for a more definite statement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e),\" and that to \"the extent that Hospital San Pablo's motion is in effect a 12(e) motion, it has been mooted by the provided report of plaintiff's obstetrical expert, Dr. Bernard Nathanson.\" However, Rubert-Torres not only relied upon Dr. Nathanson's report for the limited purpose of refuting the Hospital's motion, to the extent that it was a 12(e) motion, she also used it to argue the merits of the Rule 12(c) motion, stating: \"The departures from the applicable standard of care identified by Dr. Nathanson show that Hospital San Pablo failed to comply with its legal duties under Puerto Rico law.\" This statement directly responded to the Hospital's contention that, pursuant to applicable law, it was not liable for Kimayra's condition, and implicitly invited the district court to consider the expert report for Rule 12(c) purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as Rubert-Torres argues, that not every attachment to a Rule 12(c) motion or opposition thereto requires conversion into a motion for summary judgment. See Beddall v. State Street Bank and Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998); Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993). However, in this situation, Rubert-Torres invited the district court to consider Dr. Nathanson's report in its ruling on the merits of the Rule 12(c) motion, and thus invited the court to convert the Rule 12(c) motion into one for summary judgment. See Collier, 158 F.3d at 603; Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). The district court did not abuse its discretion when it accepted that invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres also raises numerous arguments in favor of a new trial against Dr. Rivera-Cotte. We address two of those arguments -- that Kimayra was improperly excluded from the courthouse, and that she should have been allowed to appear for a physical demonstration during questioning of an expert witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kimayra was present on the first day of trial and was briefly introduced to the pool of potential jurors before jury selection. Her attorney explained to the potential jurors that \"she will not be with us in the trial for obvious reasons for a lot of the trial, but she is entitled to be here.\" He also explained that she would not be present during jury selection because she \"was getting a little restless\" at the time and they did not want her \"to disrupt the proceedings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the district court banned Kimayra from the courtroom during opening statements. The record reflects that her attorneys did not request, and the district court did not offer, a reason for the decision. Then, apparently off the record in chambers, the district court banned Kimayra not only from the courtroom, but from the entire courthouse for the duration of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Allan Hausknecht, a neurologist, testified for Rubert-Torres. He stated that one possible cause of Kimayra's cerebral palsy was a genetic factor; that there were about 20 or 30 different physical characteristics that might show that Kimayra had genetic abnormalities; that he physically examined her and looked for those characteristics in her; and that he concluded, based upon her appearance, that her cerebral palsy was not the result of a genetic abnormality. He stated that he could demonstrate this if Kimayra were present -- otherwise it would be hard to do so. Rubert-Torres asked the district court to allow Kimayra into the courtroom briefly so that Dr. Hausknecht could physically show the jury that Kimayra did not exhibit those characteristics. The defense objected to Kimayra's presence in the courtroom, and the district court, without explanation, sustained the objection. Rubert-Torres's attorney attempted to continue asserting his position, and the district court cut him off, saying \"I said the objection is sustained.\" Shortly thereafter, out of the presence of the jury, Rubert-Torres's attorney asked for reconsideration:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If I had -- if I -- Your Honor, before I move into another area of the testimony, I just want to reiterate that I think his merely verbal testimony rather goes to characteristics that he saw in Kimayra. To rule on the genetics problem, is an extremely -- actually demonstrating those with the girl, and I don't see any undue prejudice in that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After all, she is the plaintiff, and it is the best way of making the testimony very clear, and you know it's clearly probative. To the extent that it might be prejudicial because the girl is pitiful-looking, quite frankly -- but it's very important to show that it's not a genetic problem. That's the issue of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And to the extent that we are not going to be able to do that, I wanted to preserve my objection for the record and actually to ask for reconsideration of your decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied reconsideration without explanation, but assured Rubert-Torres's attorney that his objection was \"preserved for the record.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the trial, Dr. Rivera-Cotte's pediatric neurological expert, Dr. Jess Velez-Borras, also discussed the importance of examining Kimayra's physical appearance to determine whether her cerebral palsy was genetic in origin. Dr. Velez-Borras' testimony contradicted that of Dr. Hausknecht: based upon his physical examination of Kimayra, Dr. Velez-Borras concluded that her condition was genetic in nature. Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, a genetics expert who testified for Dr. Rivera-Cotte, also partially based his conclusion that Kimayra's cerebral palsy was genetic in origin on her physical appearance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres argues that the district court violated Kimayra's due process rights when it barred Kimayra from the courtroom and eventually from the courthouse entirely, and that it abused its discretion in refusing, without explanation, to allow the neurological demonstration requiring Kimayra's presence in the courtroom. There is no dispute that Rubert-Torres preserved these issues in the district court. We review the district court's decision to exclude Kimayra from the courthouse for abuse of discretion. See Gonzalez-Marn v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 845 F.2d 1140, 1146 (1st Cir. 1988). We also review evidentiary rulings, such as the district court's decision to disallow Kimayra's presence in the courtroom for evidentiary purposes, for abuse of discretion. See Lynch v. City of Boston, 180 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first examine the district court's decision to ban Kimayra from the courthouse. Rubert-Torres relies heavily upon Helminski v. Ayerst Lab., 766 F.2d 208 (6th Cir. 1985), which we cited with approval in Gonzalez-Marn, 845 F.2d at 1146. Helminski held that a court may \"exclude the plaintiff or limit [her] presence\" without denying due process, 766 F.2d at 217, if her \"mere presence . . . would render the jury unable to arrive at an unbiased judgment concerning liability,\" id., and she cannot \"understand the proceedings and aid counsel.\" Id. at 218; Gonzalez-Marn, 845 F.2d at 1146 (\"We agree with the ruling of the Helminski court that a trial court may decide to bar from the courtroom a disabled plaintiff incapable of comprehending judicial proceedings during the liability phase of a trial in order to prevent prejudicing the jury.\"). This is so because, in that situation, the court must balance the plaintiff's due process rights with the defendant's right to an unbiased jury trial. See Helminski, 766 F.2d at 217.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Helminski outlined steps a court could take to determine whether the plaintiff could be excluded. In the usual case involving a disabled plaintiff, both parties, before trial, should raise the issue of prejudice of the jury, and the district court should hold an evidentiary hearing at which it \"observes the injured party.\" Id. At the hearing, the defendant has the burden of persuasion to show that the plaintiff should be excluded because his or her \"mere presence will prejudice the jury.\" Id. Only if the defendant persuades the district court of jury prejudice should the court question whether the plaintiff \"can comprehend the proceedings and assist counsel in any meaningful way.\" Id. at 218. A plaintiff may only be excluded from court if both her presence would prejudice the jury and she cannot understand counsel and assist in the case. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court apparently decided to exclude Kimayra from the courthouse in a meeting with counsel in chambers after trial had begun. No record of the discussion was made; therefore, we cannot know what occurred. There is no record of an evidentiary hearing. There is no indication whether the district court considered Helminski, even though we stated our approval of it in Gonzalez-Marn. The court had observed Kimayra, but did not hold an evidentiary hearing to determine prejudice of the jury. There is no record that Rivera-Cotte, who sought Kimayra's exclusion at trial, was required by the district court to bring forward evidence that Kimayra's very presence would jeopardize his right to an unbiased jury trial. The district court did not make findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record as to jury prejudice, or as to the extent to which Kimayra could comprehend and assist counsel at trial. We are thus left to review the court's decisions in a vacuum, entirely unable to determine the precise reasons why it banned Kimayra from the courtroom and the courthouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the lack of record, we are hesitant to address this important due process issue, especially if there must be a new trial on the second issue. We therefore turn to the evidentiary question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres contends there was reversible error in the district court's refusal, after Dr. Rivera-Cotte's objection, to allow Kimayra in the courtroom for the purpose of a physical demonstration during Dr. Hausknecht's testimony. The court neither stated the evidentiary rule upon which it relied, nor allowed argument on the objection, nor made findings concerning the prejudicial versus probative effect of the evidence. We can only assume that its decision was based upon Federal Rule of Evidence 403, which excludes relevant evidence because its prejudicial effect is substantially greater than its probativeness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not always require explicit findings on a Rule 403 decision, see Navarro de Cosme v. Hospital Pava, 922 F.2d 926, 931 (1st Cir. 1991), although they would assist us in our review obligation. See 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 403.03, at 403-31 to 403-32 (2d ed. 1999) (\"When a trial judge excludes evidence under Rule 403, the judge should make a clear statement of the reason for the record . . . . [R]easoned explanations are the very essence of judicial method.\") (internal quotation omitted). In our review, we give district courts \"substantial deference\" in Rule 403 decisions. Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., Inc., 43 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994). The question before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding the physical demonstration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, the evidence was highly relevant. As has been explained, experts for both Rubert-Torres and Dr. Rivera-Cotte relied upon Kimayra's physical appearance to make expert conclusions. They disagreed as to what they saw and the resultant conclusions differed. While those experts were allowed to describe Kimayra's appearance for the jury, the \"clearest evidence\" on her physical appearance would have been for the jury to see her, which is usually favored over mere description. 4 Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1158 (Chadbourn rev. 1972); see also id. &#167; 1151; Rich v. Ellerman &amp; Bucknall S.S. Co., 278 F.2d 704, 708 (2d Cir. 1960) (\"Limitation of proof of the nature of the injuries to a description by a doctor was unduly restrictive. Autoptic proference is always proper, unless reasons of policy apply to exclude it.\"). Additionally, in this case, the evidence was fundamental to the central issue in the case: causation. When proffered evidence relates to the central issue in a case, it is a difficult matter indeed to show that the prejudicial effect of that evidence substantially outweighs its highly probative nature, as Rule 403 requires. See Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 8-9; Swajian v. General Motors Corp., 916 F.2d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir. 1990). We have no findings and no statement to explain the district court's apparent disregard for this highly probative evidence on the central issue at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, even assuming the jury view preference was somewhat prejudicial, the district court could have used a less restrictive means to minimize the prejudice than entirely excluding Kimayra from the courtroom. For instance, the court might have considered limiting the amount of time she would be present before the jury, allowing her to enter and exit the courtroom outside the jury's presence, and giving limiting instructions -- all of which might minimize prejudice without requiring exclusion. See Gonzalez-Marn, 845 F.2d at 1146-47; Helminski, 766 F.2d at 217; 4 Wigmore on Evidence, supra &#167; 1158. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence favor the admissibility of evidence, less intrusive measures to minimizing the prejudicial effect of evidence are preferred to excluding evidence. See 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra &#167; 403.02[2][c].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are concerned about the somewhat arbitrary nature of the district court's Rule 403 ruling. We have reversed other Rule 403 exclusions when, as in this case, the evidentiary question is complex and not self-evident, the district court ruled before allowing a response to the objection, there were no findings on prejudice and probativeness, and a \"hair-trigger\" decision was made. See United States v. Brooks, 145 F.3d 446, 454-55 (1st Cir. 1998), citing In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 916 F.2d 829, 836 (3d Cir. 1990) and United States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that this is one of those rare and \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\" in which we must \"reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 5. We do not do so lightly, but because of the highly probative nature of the jury view of Kimayra, the lack of use of less restrictive means of eliminating the prejudicial effect of the evidence, and the \"arbitrary manner in which the judge proceeded [which] furnishes a complementary reason, powerful in itself,\" Brooks, 145 F.3d at 455, we hold that the district court abused its discretion in disallowing the demonstrative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, error in this evidentiary ruling does not require reversal unless it is harmful. \"Our [harmlessness] inquiry is whether exclusion or admission of the evidence affected plaintiff's substantial rights. The central question is whether this court can say with fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\" Lynch, 180 F.3d at 15. On such a central issue as causation, and in the absence of specific findings of prejudice, it would be speculation at best, much less with fair assurance, to say that the jury verdict was unaffected by the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Before trial, the district court entered summary judgment for the Hospital. At trial, Rubert-Torres' theory, supported by an obstetrical/gynecological (OB/GYN) expert and a neurological expert, was that physician error during her pregnancy and delivery of Kimayra caused Kimayra's disabilities. Dr. Rivera-Cotte's theory, supported by his own OB/GYN, neurological, and genetics experts, was that Kimayra's disabilities arose genetically. The jury returned a verdict for Dr. Rivera-Cotte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres first contends that the district court erred in entering summary judgment sua sponte in favor of the Hospital. This argument is slightly misworded. The district court did not enter summary judgment sua sponte; rather, it converted the Hospital's motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), into a motion for summary judgment because Rubert-Torres attached an expert witness report to her opposition to the motion to dismiss. We review whether the district court properly converted a Rule 12 motion into a motion for summary judgment for abuse of discretion. See Whiting v. Maiolini, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 1990). Significantly, Rubert-Torres only makes this procedural argument against the entry of summary judgment; she does not contest the merits of the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first recite the relevant facts. Rubert-Torres filed the complaint on July 14, 1996; the Hospital answered on October 7, 1996. Discovery started, and two scheduling conferences were held, with all parties represented, on November 26, 1996, and on April 30, 1997. At the second conference, the Hospital requested that Rubert-Torres support her allegations against it with specific facts, which she failed to do. At that point, discovery was apparently well underway: Rubert-Torres had received four expert witness reports and 20 years of medical records, interrogatories had been filed, and depositions taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Rubert-Torres failed to support her allegations against the Hospital with specific facts, the Hospital filed a motion on May 7, 1997, for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). Rubert-Torres filed an opposition to the motion on May 14, 1997, including with it an expert witness report derived from discovery. On August 15, 1997, the district court, without previously providing notice, converted the motion for judgment on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment, relied on the expert report, and entered an order for summary judgment in favor of the Hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 12(c) provides, in part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). In this regard, the rule is identical to Rule 12(b)(6), see Collier v. City of Chicopee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198170\"><a href=\"/opinion/198170/collier-v-city-of-chicopee/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 603 (1st Cir. 1998), and relevant Rule 12(b)(6) case law on conversion assists this Rule 12(c) conversion case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversion of a motion for judgment on the pleadings into one for summary judgment should only occur after the parties have been offered a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present pertinent summary judgment materials. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Whether the parties had an \"opportunity to respond necessarily turns on the way in which the particular case under consideration has unfolded.\" See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Whiting,</span> <span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">6</span></span>. Thus, we have disfavored conversion when (1) the motion comes quickly after the complaint was filed, (2) discovery is in its infancy and the nonmovant is limited in obtaining and submitting evidence to counter the motion, or (3) the nonmovant does not have reasonable notice that a conversion might occur. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 7.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, these considerations are not present. The Rule 12(c) motion came 10 months after the complaint -- and subsequent to the Hospital's request that Rubert-Torres support her allegations. There had been substantial discovery. Finally, Rubert-Torres was on constructive notice that conversion could occur. Explicit notice is not required. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198170\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Collier,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198170/collier-v-city-of-chicopee/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>; C.B.

Rubert-Torres had constructive notice because she presented the district court with additional materials in her opposition memorandum. As we recently held, \"a party receives constructive notice that the court has been afforded the option of conversion . . . when . . . the non-movant appends . . . materials [outside the pleadings] to [an] opposition and urges the court's consideration of them.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198170\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Collier,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198170/collier-v-city-of-chicopee/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>. When a plaintiff incorporates materials outside the pleadings into an opposition to a Rule 12(c) motion, the plaintiff \"implicitly invite[s] conversion -- and a party who invites conversion scarcely can be heard to complain when the trial court accepts the invitation.\" Id.; see also Maruho Co., Ltd. v.

In her response to the Hospital's Rule 12(c) motion, Rubert-Torres stated that the contentions in the motion were \"more properly framed as a motion for a more definite statement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e),\" and that to \"the extent that Hospital San Pablo's motion is in effect a 12(e) motion, it has been mooted by the provided report of plaintiff's obstetrical expert, Dr. Bernard Nathanson.\" However, Rubert-Torres not only relied upon Dr. Nathanson's report for the limited purpose of refuting the Hospital's motion, to the extent that it was a 12(e) motion, she also used it to argue the merits of the Rule 12(c) motion, stating: \"The departures from the applicable standard of care identified by Dr. Nathanson show that Hospital San Pablo failed to comply with its legal duties under Puerto Rico law.\" This statement directly responded to the Hospital's contention that, pursuant to applicable law, it was not liable for Kimayra's condition, and implicitly invited the district court to consider the expert report for Rule 12(c) purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as Rubert-Torres argues, that not every attachment to a Rule 12(c) motion or opposition thereto requires conversion into a motion for summary judgment. See Beddall v. State Street Bank and Trust Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197817\"><a href=\"/opinion/197817/beddall-v-state-street-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1998); Watterson v.

However, in this situation, Rubert-Torres invited the district court to consider Dr. Nathanson's report in its ruling on the merits of the Rule 12(c) motion, and thus invited the court to convert the Rule 12(c) motion into one for summary judgment. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198170\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Collier,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198170/collier-v-city-of-chicopee/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>; Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). The district court did not abuse its discretion when it accepted that invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres also raises numerous arguments in favor of a new trial against Dr. Rivera-Cotte. We address two of those arguments -- that Kimayra was improperly excluded from the courthouse, and that she should have been allowed to appear for a physical demonstration during questioning of an expert witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kimayra was present on the first day of trial and was briefly introduced to the pool of potential jurors before jury selection. Her attorney explained to the potential jurors that \"she will not be with us in the trial for obvious reasons for a lot of the trial, but she is entitled to be here.\" He also explained that she would not be present during jury selection because she \"was getting a little restless\" at the time and they did not want her \"to disrupt the proceedings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the district court banned Kimayra from the courtroom during opening statements. The record reflects that her attorneys did not request, and the district court did not offer, a reason for the decision. Then, apparently off the record in chambers, the district court banned Kimayra not only from the courtroom, but from the entire courthouse for the duration of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Allan Hausknecht, a neurologist, testified for Rubert-Torres. He stated that one possible cause of Kimayra's cerebral palsy was a genetic factor; that there were about 20 or 30 different physical characteristics that might show that Kimayra had genetic abnormalities; that he physically examined her and looked for those characteristics in her; and that he concluded, based upon her appearance, that her cerebral palsy was not the result of a genetic abnormality. He stated that he could demonstrate this if Kimayra were present -- otherwise it would be hard to do so. Rubert-Torres asked the district court to allow Kimayra into the courtroom briefly so that Dr. Hausknecht could physically show the jury that Kimayra did not exhibit those characteristics. The defense objected to Kimayra's presence in the courtroom, and the district court, without explanation, sustained the objection. Rubert-Torres's attorney attempted to continue asserting his position, and the district court cut him off, saying \"I said the objection is sustained.\" Shortly thereafter, out of the presence of the jury, Rubert-Torres's attorney asked for reconsideration:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If I had -- if I -- Your Honor, before I move into another area of the testimony, I just want to reiterate that I think his merely verbal testimony rather goes to characteristics that he saw in Kimayra. To rule on the genetics problem, is an extremely -- actually demonstrating those with the girl, and I don't see any undue prejudice in that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After all, she is the plaintiff, and it is the best way of making the testimony very clear, and you know it's clearly probative. To the extent that it might be prejudicial because the girl is pitiful-looking, quite frankly -- but it's very important to show that it's not a genetic problem. That's the issue of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And to the extent that we are not going to be able to do that, I wanted to preserve my objection for the record and actually to ask for reconsideration of your decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied reconsideration without explanation, but assured Rubert-Torres's attorney that his objection was \"preserved for the record.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the trial, Dr. Rivera-Cotte's pediatric neurological expert, Dr. Jess Velez-Borras, also discussed the importance of examining Kimayra's physical appearance to determine whether her cerebral palsy was genetic in origin. Dr. Velez-Borras' testimony contradicted that of Dr. Hausknecht: based upon his physical examination of Kimayra, Dr. Velez-Borras concluded that her condition was genetic in nature. Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, a genetics expert who testified for Dr. Rivera-Cotte, also partially based his conclusion that Kimayra's cerebral palsy was genetic in origin on her physical appearance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres argues that the district court violated Kimayra's due process rights when it barred Kimayra from the courtroom and eventually from the courthouse entirely, and that it abused its discretion in refusing, without explanation, to allow the neurological demonstration requiring Kimayra's presence in the courtroom. There is no dispute that Rubert-Torres preserved these issues in the district court. We review the district court's decision to exclude Kimayra from the courthouse for abuse of discretion. See Gonzalez-Marn v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505496\"><a href=\"/opinion/505496/neftali-gonzalez-marin-v-the-equitable-life-assurance-society-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span>, 1146 (1st Cir. 1988).

No record of the discussion was made; therefore, we cannot know what occurred. There is no record of an evidentiary hearing. There is no indication whether the district court considered Helminski, even though we stated our approval of it in Gonzalez-Marn. The court had observed Kimayra, but did not hold an evidentiary hearing to determine prejudice of the jury. There is no record that Rivera-Cotte, who sought Kimayra's exclusion at trial, was required by the district court to bring forward evidence that Kimayra's very presence would jeopardize his right to an unbiased jury trial. The district court did not make findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record as to jury prejudice, or as to the extent to which Kimayra could comprehend and assist counsel at trial. We are thus left to review the court's decisions in a vacuum, entirely unable to determine the precise reasons why it banned Kimayra from the courtroom and the courthouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the lack of record, we are hesitant to address this important due process issue, especially if there must be a new trial on the second issue. We therefore turn to the evidentiary question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubert-Torres contends there was reversible error in the district court's refusal, after Dr. Rivera-Cotte's objection, to allow Kimayra in the courtroom for the purpose of a physical demonstration during Dr. Hausknecht's testimony. The court neither stated the evidentiary rule upon which it relied, nor allowed argument on the objection, nor made findings concerning the prejudicial versus probative effect of the evidence. We can only assume that its decision was based upon Federal Rule of Evidence 403, which excludes relevant evidence because its prejudicial effect is substantially greater than its probativeness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not always require explicit findings on a Rule 403 decision, see Navarro de Cosme v. Hospital Pava, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553839\"><a href=\"/opinion/553839/maria-r-navarro-de-cosme-v-hospital-pavia/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span>, 931 (1st Cir. 1991), although they would assist us in our review obligation. See 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 403.03, at 403-31 to 403-32 (2d ed. 1999) (\"When a trial judge excludes evidence under Rule 403, the judge should make a clear statement of the reason for the record . . . . [R]easoned explanations are the very essence of judicial method.\") (internal quotation omitted). In our review, we give district courts \"substantial deference\" in Rule 403 decisions. Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685127\"><a href=\"/opinion/685127/41-fed-r-evid-serv-94-prodliabrep-cch-p-14121-william-and-rita/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1994). The question before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding the physical demonstration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, the evidence was highly relevant. As has been explained, experts for both Rubert-Torres and Dr. Rivera-Cotte relied upon Kimayra's physical appearance to make expert conclusions. They disagreed as to what they saw and the resultant conclusions differed. While those experts were allowed to describe Kimayra's appearance for the jury, the \"clearest evidence\" on her physical appearance would have been for the jury to see her, which is usually favored over mere description. 4 Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1158 (Chadbourn rev. 1972); see also id. &#167; 1151; Rich v. Ellerman &amp; Bucknall S.S. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"251053\"><a href=\"/opinion/251053/callie-rich-v-ellerman-bucknall-ss-co-ltd-and-third-party-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>, 708 (2d Cir. 1960) (\"Limitation of proof of the nature of the injuries to a description by a doctor was unduly restrictive. Autoptic proference is always proper, unless reasons of policy apply to exclude it.\"). Additionally, in this case, the evidence was fundamental to the central issue in the case: causation. When proffered evidence relates to the central issue in a case, it is a difficult matter indeed to show that the prejudicial effect of that evidence substantially outweighs its highly probative nature, as Rule 403 requires.

We have no findings and no statement to explain the district court's apparent disregard for this highly probative evidence on the central issue at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, even assuming the jury view preference was somewhat prejudicial, the district court could have used a less restrictive means to minimize the prejudice than entirely excluding Kimayra from the courtroom. For instance, the court might have considered limiting the amount of time she would be present before the jury, allowing her to enter and exit the courtroom outside the jury's presence, and giving limiting instructions -- all of which might minimize prejudice without requiring exclusion. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505496\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gonzalez-Marn,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/505496/neftali-gonzalez-marin-v-the-equitable-life-assurance-society-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1146</span></a></span>-47; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454586\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Helminski,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/454586/catherine-and-frank-helminski-as-next-friends-of-minor-hugh-helminski-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span>; 4 Wigmore on Evidence, supra &#167; 1158. Because the Federal Rules of Evidence favor the admissibility of evidence, less intrusive measures to minimizing the prejudicial effect of evidence are preferred to excluding evidence. See 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra &#167; 403.02[2][c].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are concerned about the somewhat arbitrary nature of the district court's Rule 403 ruling. We have reversed other Rule 403 exclusions when, as in this case, the evidentiary question is complex and not self-evident, the district court ruled before allowing a response to the objection, there were no findings on prejudice and probativeness, and a \"hair-trigger\" decision was made.

We do not do so lightly, but because of the highly probative nature of the jury view of Kimayra, the lack of use of less restrictive means of eliminating the prejudicial effect of the evidence, and the \"arbitrary manner in which the judge proceeded [which] furnishes a complementary reason, powerful in itself,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197996\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brooks,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197996/united-states-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>, we hold that the district court abused its discretion in disallowing the demonstrative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, error in this evidentiary ruling does not require reversal unless it is harmful. \"Our [harmlessness] inquiry is whether exclusion or admission of the evidence affected plaintiff's substantial rights.

On such a central issue as causation, and in the absence of specific findings of prejudice, it would be speculation at best, much less with fair assurance, to say that the jury verdict was unaffected by the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
