VEALE,\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\nDAVID A. GRIFFIN, Individually and as a State Police Trooper,\n               for the State of New Hampshire;\n                   STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n        [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Scott W. Veale on brief pro se.\n     Philip T. McLaughlin, Attorney General,      and Daniel J.\nMullen, Senior Assistant Attorney General,        on brief for\nappellees.\n\f                         JUNE 6, 2000\n\n\n          Per Curiam. Appellant Scott W. Veale brought a\n\ncivil rights action, based on 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985(3),\n\nagainst the state of New Hampshire and David A. Griffin, a\n\nNew Hampshire state trooper.     Appellant also listed claims\n\nunder state law.   The district court dismissed the action on\n\nthe grounds that it had no jurisdiction over the § 1985(3)\n\nclaim and that the claims under § 1983 and state law were\n\nbarred by the applicable statute of limitations.     The court\n\nalso determined that appellant's claims against the state of\n\nNew Hampshire and against Trooper Griffin in his official\n\ncapacity were barred by the Eleventh Amendment.      Appellant\n\ncontests only the dismissal of his §§ 1983 and 1985(3)\n\nclaims.   For the following reasons, we affirm the district\n\ncourt judgment.\n\n          1.   The § 1985(3) Claim.     Even assuming that the\n\namended   complaint   stated   sufficient   allegations   of   a\n\nconspiracy, it is obvious that appellant cannot show that\n\ndefendants' acts were \"propelled by some racial, or perhaps\n\notherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.\"\n\nSee Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). That is,\n\nalthough appellant uses the phrase \"class-based,\" it seems\n\fplain that he is claiming that the defendants' alleged\n\ndiscrimination          was    premised        on    the   activities        he    has\n\nundertaken in an effort to obtain title to the land in\n\nMarlborough.       However, \"a class, to be cognizable, must be\n\nidentifiable       by    reference        to    something      more     than       the\n\nmembers' desire to engage in conduct that the § 1985(3)\n\ndefendant disfavors.\"             Id. at 5 (internal punctuation and\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n             In other words, the line drawn by the\n             substantive characteristic must divide\n             individuals into distinct, separate, and\n             identifiable groups.    This means, for\n             example, \"white\" as opposed to \"non-\n             white,\" \"female\" as opposed to \"male,\"\n             or, if political classes are includable\n             -- a matter on which we do not opine --\n             \"registered Republicans\" as opposed to\n             other voters.\n\nId.     at   5-6   (citations       omitted).              Plainly,    the        class\n\ndescribed by appellant does not meet this requirement.\n\n             Further, to the extent that appellant is claiming\n\nthat he belongs to some kind of economic class of persons\n\nwho own land, this claim also is unavailing.                          The Supreme\n\nCourt    has   made      clear     that    §        1985(3)   does     not    reach\n\n“conspiracies motivated by bias towards others on account of\n\ntheir economic views, status, or activities.”                         See United\n\nBhd. Of Carpenters v. Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 837-38 (1983)\n\n(emphasis added).             Since appellant plainly cannot make out\n\n                                      -3-\n\fa   §   1985(3)   claim,   and   amendment   would   be   futile,   the\n\ndismissal of this claim is affirmed.          See Smith v. Boyd, 945\n\nF.2d 1041, 1043 (8th Cir. 1991); Baker v. Director, U.S.\n\nParole Comm'n, 916 F.2d 725, 726 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (per\n\ncuriam); Shockley v. Jones, 823 F.2d 1068, 1072-73 (7th Cir.\n\n1987).\n\n            2.    The § 1983 Claim.     As the district court found,\n\nappellant, in his original complaint and throughout the\n\ndistrict court proceedings, focused on a claim of false\n\narrest.     The court held that this claim was untimely.             We\n\nagree.\n\n            A claim under § 1983 accrues \"when the plaintiff\n\nknows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis\n\nof the action.\"      Calero-Colon v. Betancourt-Lebron, 68 F.3d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).    Appellant's arrest in this case was warrantless.\n\nThus, his claim, in relation to the lack of probable cause\n\nto arrest, is akin to one for false arrest.               See id. at 4\n\n(\"wrongful warrantless arrests typically resemble the tort\n\nof false arrest\").      Because the allegedly illegal search was\n\na part of appellant's arrest, we consider the search claim\n\nas a component of the false arrest claim.            See Beck v. City\n\nof Muskogee Police Dep't, 195 F.3d 553, 557-59 (10th Cir.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f1999) (where the search and the arrest occurred during the\n\nsame time period, the court treated plaintiff's illegal\n\nsearch and seizure claim and false arrest claim as one cause\n\nof action for the purpose of determining the timeliness of\n\nplaintiff's § 1983 action).\n\n             A claim for false arrest usually begins to run at\n\nthe time of arrest.           Calero-Colon, 68 F.3d at 4 (Lynch, J.,\n\nconcurring).         See also Rose v. Bartle, 871 F.2d 331, 350 (3d\n\nCir. 1989) (a § 1983 claim based on false arrest accrues on\n\nthe date of the arrest).            If the usual rule applies, then,\n\nappellant's cause of action for illegal search and false\n\narrest accrued on October 23, 1994 – the date of the search\n\nand the arrest.             Thus, appellant's complaint, filed over\n\nthree years later on March 13, 1998, would be time-barred.\n\n             We see no reason why the usual rule should not\n\napply in this case.             Although appellant attempts to argue\n\nthat his arrest and the search were part of an ongoing\n\nconspiracy       –    the   last   act   of   which   was   the   allegedly\n\nmalicious prosecution – there is no support in the record\n\nfor   such   a       finding.      Specifically,      appellant   does   not\n\nallege, and there is no evidence, that Trooper Griffin went\n\nlooking for appellant with the                already-formed purpose of\n\ncausing appellant to be arrested and prosecuted for drug\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fpossession.   Thus, this is a case where the arrest was a\n\ndiscrete occurrence, rather than a part of a continuing\n\nconspiracy, and the false arrest claim, as the district\n\ncourt found, is time-barred.        Compare Robinson v. Maruffi,\n\n895 F.2d 649 (10th Cir. 1990).\n\n         Finding     no   merit    in   the   remaining   arguments\n\nappellant raises on appeal, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
