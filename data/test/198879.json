The appellants, Angel Ruiz\n\nRivera (Ruiz), Instituto de Educacion Universal (the Institute),\n\nand five other individuals who, like Ruiz, are affiliated with\n\nthe Institute, brought this action against the United States\n\nDepartment      of    Education          (DOE)      and     various      DOE     hierarchs\n\n(including     the     Secretary),        seeking         money      damages    and   other\n\nrelief pursuant to the doctrine of Bivens v. Six Unknown Named\n\nAgents   of    Fed.     Bureau      of    Narcotics,           403   U.S.    388   (1971).\n\n\"Bivens is the case establishing, as a general proposition, that\n\nvictims of a constitutional violation perpetrated by a federal\n\nactor may sue the offender for damages in federal court despite\n\nthe absence of explicit statutory authorization for such suits.\"\n\nWright v. Park, 5 F.3d 586, 589 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993).                               To lend\n\nperspective, we begin by summarizing certain uncontroversial\n\nbackground facts.\n\n            The      Institute      is    a    private,        not-for-profit,        post-\n\nsecondary educational institution founded by Ruiz and based in\n\nPuerto   Rico.         Historically,           its     recruitment          efforts    have\n\ndepended      heavily    on       the    availability           of     federal     student\n\nfinancial assistance programs.                 In 1994, DOE's Inspector General\n\nundertook an audit that led to various determinations adverse to\n\nthe   Institute.        As    a    result        of   the      auditors'       preliminary\n\nfindings,     DOE    placed       the    Institute        in    \"reimbursement        only\"\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fstatus    (a    status   that   barred    the   Institute      from   receiving\n\nstudent aid payments prospectively, as is usually the case).\n\nFive months later, DOE levied a substantial fine and announced\n\nits   intention     to   terminate    the   Institute's     eligibility      for\n\nparticipation in federal student aid programs altogether.                     In\n\nJune 1996, DOE issued the final audit report and instituted\n\ncollection      proceedings     to   recover    upwards   of    $2,600,000    in\n\nalleged overcharges, unpaid refunds, and the like.\n\n               Asserting that DOE had botched the audit and acted\n\nfecklessly, the appellants filed this Bivens action in Puerto\n\nRico's    federal    district    court.        Their   complaint      attributed\n\nsundry due process violations to the appellees, implicating the\n\nhandling of the audit, the denial of eligibility for student\n\nfinancial assistance programs in respect to a newly constructed\n\nbranch campus, and the \"reimbursement only\" determination.                    In\n\ntime, the appellees moved for summary judgment.                In response to\n\nthat motion, the district court disposed of many facets of the\n\ncase,1 but left intact the appellants' Bivens claims.                        See\n\n\n\n\n      1\n     The court ruled, inter alia, that certain audit-related\nchallenges were not ripe for adjudication because the appellants\nstill were pursuing the administrative review process.       See\nInstituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. Riley, 973 F. Supp.\n95, 98 (D.P.R. 1997).     As to other claims, it granted the\nappellees' prayer for brevis disposition. See id.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fInstituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. Riley, 973 F. Supp.\n\n95, 98 (D.P.R. 1997).\n\n          After      a    considerable    interval       (during    which    the\n\nadministrative review was completed), the appellees moved to\n\namend the judgment nunc pro tunc to include the Bivens claims.\n\nRuiz, then proceeding pro se, opposed the motion and cross-moved\n\nto   revoke   the   earlier    grant     of    partial    summary      judgment,\n\nattaching a plethora of papers that he termed \"new evidence.\"\n\nThe district court reconsidered its earlier ruling but declined\n\nto modify it in the manner that Ruiz had requested.                          See\n\nInstituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. Riley, Civ. No. 96-\n\n1893, slip op. at 9-13 (D.P.R. Jan. 21, 1999).                  The court then\n\nproceeded to treat the appellees' nunc pro tunc motion as a\n\nrenewed request for summary judgment on the Bivens claims, and\n\ngranted it.    See id. at 13-19.\n\n          This      appeal    ensued.         For    argument    purposes,    we\n\nconsolidated it with another appeal (No. 99-1628) involving\n\nessentially the same cast of characters.                  We have elected,\n\nhowever, to decide the two appeals separately.                     This is the\n\nsecond   of   the   two    opinions,     and    we    presume    the   reader's\n\nfamiliarity with the first.\n\n          We have remarked before — and today reaffirm — that\n\nwhen a nisi prius court produces a well-reasoned exposition that\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ftouches all the necessary bases, a reviewing court may do well\n\nnot to wax longiloquent.      See, e.g., Cruz-Ramos v. Puerto Rico\n\nSun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 383 (1st Cir. 2000); Ayala v. Union\n\nde Tronquistas, 74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); In re San Juan\n\nDupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nThis case fits that familiar specification:       after careful study\n\nof the voluminous record, the parties' briefs, and the arguments\n\npresented orally, we find no basis for disturbing the district\n\ncourt's clearly expressed rulings.      Accordingly, we affirm the\n\njudgment below for substantially the reasons articulated in\n\nJudge   Fusté's   serial   opinions.   We   add   only   four   sets   of\n\ncomments.\n\n            First:   Because the appellants' previous counsel had\n\nwithdrawn from the case, only Ruiz (a non-lawyer) signed the\n\nnotice of appeal.     The appellees argue that this circumstance\n\ndeprives us of appellate jurisdiction.       This is true as to the\n\nindividual plaintiffs other then Ruiz.        Generally speaking, a\n\nnotice of appeal that is not signed either by the appealing\n\nparty or by that party's attorney is a nullity.             See, e.g.,\n\nTalley-Bey v. Knebl, 168 F.3d 884, 885 (6th Cir. 1999); Carter\n\nv. Stalder, 60 F.3d 238, 239 (5th Cir. 1995); United States v.\n\nJohnson, 43 F.3d 1308, 1310 n.1 (9th Cir. 1995); Lewis v. Lenc-\n\nSmith Mfg. Co., 784 F.2d 829, 830-31 (7th Cir. 1986); Covington\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fv. Allsbrook, 636 F.2d 63, 63-64 (4th Cir. 1980); Scarrella v.\n\nMidwest Fed. Sav. & Loan, 536 F.2d 1207, 1209 (8th Cir. 1976).\n\n           It is a closer question as to whether the notice of\n\nappeal signed by Ruiz has force as to the Institute.             We have\n\nheld today, in the companion case alluded to earlier, that it\n\ndoes.     See Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. United\n\nStates Dep't of Educ., No 99-1628, slip op. at 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    Consequently, this appeal is properly before us as to\n\nthe claims of Ruiz and the Institute.\n\n           Second:      Like the district court, we construe the\n\nappellants' so-called \"Request to Revoke Summary Judgment\" as a\n\nmotion for reconsideration.         The district court, in its own\n\nwords,    \"spen[t]      numerous   hours    foraging\"      through,     and\n\n\"painstakingly cull[ing],\" the amplitudinous exhibits that the\n\nappellants submitted.       After inspecting these submissions, the\n\ncourt adhered to its original decision and concluded that no\n\nshowing    had   been   made   sufficient   to   warrant   a   change    in\n\ndirection.\n\n           This determination deserves appreciable deference.            An\n\nappellate court ought not to overturn a trial court's denial of\n\na motion for reconsideration unless a miscarriage of justice is\n\nin prospect or the record otherwise reveals a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion.      See Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fCir. 1997); In re Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).   The materials on which the appellants rely are, at best,\n\nvaguely suggestive; they are \"scarcely the kind of overwhelming\n\nproof that might make a [refusal to revoke summary judgment] a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\"          Minh Tu v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 136\n\nF.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 1998).             Thus, they are insufficient to\n\ndemonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in\n\ndeclining to reopen issues previously laid to rest.\n\n            Third:   The district court granted summary judgment on\n\nthe Bivens claims because it spied no genuine issue of material\n\nfact and believed that the appellees were entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.        We agree with that determination.                Wholly\n\napart from the merits, however, the district court would have\n\nbeen well within its authority to enter judgment based on the\n\nappellants' blatant disregard of D.P.R.R. 311.12 (providing in\n\nrelevant    part    that   a   party    opposing    a   motion    for      summary\n\njudgment shall include in her opposition \"a separate, short, and\n\nconcise statement of the material facts as to which it is\n\ncontended    that    there     exists    a    genuine   issue    to   be   tried,\n\nproperly supported by specific reference to the record\").                      The\n\nappellants did not make the slightest effort to comply with this\n\nrequirement.       Consequently, they must bear the onus of that\n\nneglect.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f           Rules such as Local Rule 311.12 were developed by the\n\ndistrict courts in this circuit in response to this court's\n\nconcern that, absent such rules, summary judgment practice could\n\ntoo easily become a game of cat-and-mouse, giving rise to the\n\n\"specter of district court judges being unfairly sandbagged by\n\nunadvertised      factual       issues.\"     Stepanischen       v.    Merchants\n\nDespatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 931 (1st Cir. 1983).                   Such\n\nrules are a distinct improvement — and parties ignore them at\n\ntheir peril.\n\n           In that spirit, we have held that noncompliance with\n\nsuch a rule, as manifested by a failure to present a statement\n\nof disputed facts, embroidered with specific citations to the\n\nrecord, justifies the court's deeming the facts presented in the\n\nmovant's   statement       of   undisputed     facts   admitted      and   ruling\n\naccordingly.      See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95\n\nF.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir. 1996); Rivas v. Federacion de Asociaciones\n\nPecuarias, 929 F.2d 814, 816 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991); Laracuente v.\n\nChase Manhattan Bank, 891 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1989).                         We\n\nbelieve    that    such     a    disposition    would    have     been     wholly\n\nappropriate here.2        Viewed in that light, the appellants' brazen\n\n\n    2The fact that Ruiz was proceeding pro se at the point the\nappellees filed the nunc pro tunc motion does not alter this\nconclusion. We have held consistently that pro se status does\nnot free a litigant in a civil case of the obligation to comply\nwith procedural rules. See Eagle Eye Fishing Corp. v. United\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdisregard of Local Rule 311.12 constitutes an independently\n\nsufficient ground for affirmance of the judgment below.\n\n          Fourth:     There is one final, decisive point:              to the\n\nextent that the appellants' factual proffer might conceivably be\n\nthought to support Bivens liability — and we, like the lower\n\ncourt, do not believe that it does — their suit names the wrong\n\ndefendants.   It is well settled that a Bivens action will not\n\nlie against an agency of the federal government.               See FDIC v.\n\nMeyer, 510 U.S. 471, 486 (1994).              The same holds true as to\n\nfederal   officials   sued       in   their   official   capacities.      See\n\nAffiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala, 164 F.3d\n\n282, 286 (5th Cir. 1999); Buford v. Runyon, 160 F.3d 1199, 1203\n\n(8th Cir. 1998); Sanchez-Mariani v. Ellingwood, 691 F.2d 592,\n\n596 (1st Cir. 1982).         A    Bivens action only may be brought\n\nagainst federal officials in their individual capacities.                Even\n\nthen, the plaintiff must state a claim for direct rather than\n\nvicarious liability; respondeat superior is not a viable theory\n\nof Bivens liability.     See Bibeau v. Pacific Northwest Research\n\n\nStates Dep't of Commerce, 20 F.3d 503, 506 (1st Cir. 1994)\n(explaining that \"the right of self-representation is not a\nlicense not to comply with relevant rules\" (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted)); FDIC v. Anchor Props., 13\nF.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"We have consistently held that a\nlitigant's pro se status [does not] absolve him from compliance\nwith [either] the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [or] a\ndistrict court's procedural rules.\" (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fFound., 188 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 1998); Buford, 160 F.3d at\n\n1203 n.7;       Cronn v.      Buffington, 150 F.3d 538, 544 (5th Cir.\n\n1998); Simpkins v. District of Columbia Gov't, 108 F.3d 366, 369\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1997); cf. Aponte Matos v. Toledo-Dávila, 135 F.3d\n\n182, 192 (1st Cir. 1998) (reaching identical conclusion in suit\n\nbrought against state actors under 42 U.S.C. § 1983); Gutierrez-\n\nRodriguez       v.    Cartagena,      882    F.2d   553,    562   (1st    Cir.     1989)\n\n(same).\n\n            To be sure, supervisors sometimes may be held liable\n\nfor failures in carrying out their supervisory responsibilities.\n\nSee, e.g., Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d 41, 43-44 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).     Be that as it may, supervisory liability exists only\n\nwhere     \"(1)       there    is   subordinate       liability,      and     (2)    the\n\nsupervisor's action or inaction was 'affirmatively linked' to\n\nthe constitutional violation caused by the subordinate.\"                         Aponte\n\nMatos,    135    F.3d    at    192.     Here,       the    appellants'     claims     of\n\nmalfeasance and misfeasance principally involve two relatively\n\nlow-level DOE staffers, Náter and Rios — yet neither man is\n\nnamed as a defendant.              Assuming arguendo subordinate liability\n\non   Náter's         and/or    Rios's       part,    the    record       contains    no\n\nsignificantly probative evidence establishing any affirmative\n\nlink, sufficient to support a finding of culpability, between\n\n\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\fthe actions of which the appellants complain and the persons\n\nwhom they elected to sue.\n\n            We   need   go   no   further.   With   these   modest\n\naugmentations, we uphold the judgment below for substantially\n\nthe reasons stated at greater length by the lower court in its\n\nserial opinions.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f",

Historically, its recruitment efforts have depended heavily on the availability of federal student financial assistance programs. In 1994, DOE's Inspector General undertook an audit that led to various determinations adverse to the Institute. As a result of the auditors' preliminary findings, DOE placed the Institute in \"reimbursement only\" status (a status that barred the Institute from receiving student aid payments prospectively, as is usually the case). Five months later, DOE levied a substantial fine and announced its intention to terminate the Institute's eligibility for participation in federal student aid programs altogether. In June 1996, DOE issued the final audit report and instituted collection proceedings to recover upwards of $2,600,000 in alleged overcharges, unpaid refunds, and the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asserting that DOE had botched the audit and acted fecklessly, the appellants filed this Bivens action in Puerto Rico's federal district court. Their complaint attributed sundry due process violations to the appellees, implicating the handling of the audit, the denial of eligibility for student financial assistance programs in respect to a newly constructed branch campus, and the \"reimbursement only\" determination. In time, the appellees moved for summary judgment. In response to that motion, the district court disposed of many facets of the case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but left intact the appellants' Bivens claims. See Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. Riley, 973 F. Supp. 95, 98 (D.P.R. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a considerable interval (during which the administrative review was completed), the appellees moved to amend the judgment nunc pro tunc to include the Bivens claims. Ruiz, then proceeding pro se, opposed the motion and cross-moved to revoke the earlier grant of partial summary judgment, attaching a plethora of papers that he termed \"new evidence.\" The district court reconsidered its earlier ruling but declined to modify it in the manner that Ruiz had requested. See Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. Riley, Civ. No. 96-1893, slip op. at 9-13 (D.P.R. Jan. 21, 1999). The court then proceeded to treat the appellees' nunc pro tunc motion as a renewed request for summary judgment on the Bivens claims, and granted it. See id. at 13-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal ensued. For argument purposes, we consolidated it with another appeal (No. 99-1628) involving essentially the same cast of characters. We have elected, however, to decide the two appeals separately. This is the second of the two opinions, and we presume the reader's familiarity with the first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have remarked before -- and today reaffirm -- that when a nisi prius court produces a well-reasoned exposition that touches all the necessary bases, a reviewing court may do well not to wax longiloquent. See, e.g., Cruz-Ramos v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 383 (1st Cir. 2000); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas, 74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993). This case fits that familiar specification: after careful study of the voluminous record, the parties' briefs, and the arguments presented orally, we find no basis for disturbing the district court's clearly expressed rulings. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below for substantially the reasons articulated in Judge Fust's serial opinions. We add only four sets of comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First: Because the appellants' previous counsel had withdrawn from the case, only Ruiz (a non-lawyer) signed the notice of appeal. The appellees argue that this circumstance deprives us of appellate jurisdiction. This is true as to the individual plaintiffs other then Ruiz. Generally speaking, a notice of appeal that is not signed either by the appealing party or by that party's attorney is a nullity. See, e.g., Talley-Bey v. Knebl, 168 F.3d 884, 885 (6th Cir. 1999); Carter v. Stalder, 60 F.3d 238, 239 (5th Cir. 1995); United States v. Johnson, 43 F.3d 1308, 1310 n.1 (9th Cir. 1995); Lewis v. Lenc-Smith Mfg. Co., 784 F.2d 829, 830-31 (7th Cir. 1986); Covington v. Allsbrook, 636 F.2d 63, 63-64 (4th Cir. 1980); Scarrella v. Midwest Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 536 F.2d 1207, 1209 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a closer question as to whether the notice of appeal signed by Ruiz has force as to the Institute. We have held today, in the companion case alluded to earlier, that it does. See Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. United States Dep't of Educ., No 99-1628, slip op. at 8 (1st Cir. 2000). Consequently, this appeal is properly before us as to the claims of Ruiz and the Institute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second: Like the district court, we construe the appellants' so-called \"Request to Revoke Summary Judgment\" as a motion for reconsideration. The district court, in its own words, \"spen[t] numerous hours foraging\" through, and \"painstakingly cull[ing],\" the amplitudinous exhibits that the appellants submitted. After inspecting these submissions, the court adhered to its original decision and concluded that no showing had been made sufficient to warrant a change in direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This determination deserves appreciable deference. An appellate court ought not to overturn a trial court's denial of a motion for reconsideration unless a miscarriage of justice is in prospect or the record otherwise reveals a manifest abuse of discretion. See Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1997); In re Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1987). The materials on which the appellants rely are, at best, vaguely suggestive; they are \"scarcely the kind of overwhelming proof that might make a [refusal to revoke summary judgment] a miscarriage of justice.\" Minh Tu v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 136 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 1998). Thus, they are insufficient to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in declining to reopen issues previously laid to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third: The district court granted summary judgment on the Bivens claims because it spied no genuine issue of material fact and believed that the appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We agree with that determination. Wholly apart from the merits, however, the district court would have been well within its authority to enter judgment based on the appellants' blatant disregard of D.P.R.R. 311.12 (providing in relevant part that a party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall include in her opposition \"a separate, short, and concise statement of the material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried, properly supported by specific reference to the record\"). The appellants did not make the slightest effort to comply with this requirement. Consequently, they must bear the onus of that neglect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rules such as Local Rule 311.12 were developed by the district courts in this circuit in response to this court's concern that, absent such rules, summary judgment practice could too easily become a game of cat-and-mouse, giving rise to the \"specter of district court judges being unfairly sandbagged by unadvertised factual issues.\" Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 931 (1st Cir. 1983). Such rules are a distinct improvement -- and parties ignore them at their peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that spirit, we have held that noncompliance with such a rule, as manifested by a failure to present a statement of disputed facts, embroidered with specific citations to the record, justifies the court's deeming the facts presented in the movant's statement of undisputed facts admitted and ruling accordingly. See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir. 1996); Rivas v. Federacion de Asociaciones Pecuarias, 929 F.2d 814, 816 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991); Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 891 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1989). We believe that such a disposition would have been wholly appropriate here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Viewed in that light, the appellants' brazen disregard of Local Rule 311.12 constitutes an independently sufficient ground for affirmance of the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth: There is one final, decisive point: to the extent that the appellants' factual proffer might conceivably be thought to support Bivens liability -- and we, like the lower court, do not believe that it does -- their suit names the wrong defendants. It is well settled that a Bivens action will not lie against an agency of the federal government. See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 486 (1994). The same holds true as to federal officials sued in their official capacities. See Affiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala, 164 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir. 1999); Buford v. Runyon, 160 F.3d 1199, 1203 (8th Cir. 1998); Sanchez-Mariani v. Ellingwood, 691 F.2d 592, 596 (1st Cir. 1982). A Bivens action only may be brought against federal officials in their individual capacities. Even then, the plaintiff must state a claim for direct rather than vicarious liability; respondeat superior is not a viable theory of Bivens liability. See Bibeau v. Pacific Northwest Research Found., 188 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 1998); Buford, 160 F.3d at 1203 n.7; Cronn v. Buffington, 150 F.3d 538, 544 (5th Cir. 1998); Simpkins v. District of Columbia Gov't, 108 F.3d 366, 369 (D.C. Cir. 1997); cf. Aponte Matos v. Toledo-Dvila, 135 F.3d 182, 192 (1st Cir. 1998) (reaching identical conclusion in suit brought against state actors under 42 U.S.C.  1983); Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir. 1989) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, supervisors sometimes may be held liable for failures in carrying out their supervisory responsibilities. See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d 41, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1999). Be that as it may, supervisory liability exists only where \"(1) there is subordinate liability, and (2) the supervisor's action or inaction was 'affirmatively linked' to the constitutional violation caused by the subordinate.\" Aponte Matos, 135 F.3d at 192. Here, the appellants' claims of malfeasance and misfeasance principally involve two relatively low-level DOE staffers, Nter and Rios -- yet neither man is named as a defendant. Assuming arguendo subordinate liability on Nter's and/or Rios's part, the record contains no significantly probative evidence establishing any affirmative link, sufficient to support a finding of culpability, between the actions of which the appellants complain and the persons whom they elected to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. With these modest augmentations, we uphold the judgment below for substantially the reasons stated at greater length by the lower court in its serial opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court ruled, inter alia, that certain audit-related challenges were not ripe for adjudication because the appellants still were pursuing the administrative review process. See Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. Riley, 973 F. Supp. 95, 98 (D.P.R. 1997). As to other claims, it granted the appellees' prayer for brevis disposition. See id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The fact that Ruiz was proceeding pro se at the point the appellees filed the nunc pro tunc motion does not alter this conclusion. We have held consistently that pro se status does not free a litigant in a civil case of the obligation to comply with procedural rules. See Eagle Eye Fishing Corp. v. United States Dep't of Commerce, 20 F.3d 503, 506 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining that \"the right of self-representation is not a license not to comply with relevant rules\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); FDIC v. Anchor Props., 13 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"We have consistently held that a litigant's pro se status [does not] absolve him from compliance with [either] the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [or] a district court's procedural rules.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Historically, its recruitment efforts have depended heavily on the availability of federal student financial assistance programs. In 1994, DOE's Inspector General undertook an audit that led to various determinations adverse to the Institute. As a result of the auditors' preliminary findings, DOE placed the Institute in \"reimbursement only\" status (a status that barred the Institute from receiving student aid payments prospectively, as is usually the case). Five months later, DOE levied a substantial fine and announced its intention to terminate the Institute's eligibility for participation in federal student aid programs altogether.

The materials on which the appellants rely are, at best, vaguely suggestive; they are \"scarcely the kind of overwhelming proof that might make a [refusal to revoke summary judgment] a miscarriage of justice.\" Minh Tu v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751606\"><a href=\"/opinion/751606/minh-tu-v-mutual-life-insurance-company-of-new-york-union-central-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir. 1998). Thus, they are insufficient to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in declining to reopen issues previously laid to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third: The district court granted summary judgment on the Bivens claims because it spied no genuine issue of material fact and believed that the appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We agree with that determination. Wholly apart from the merits, however, the district court would have been well within its authority to enter judgment based on the appellants' blatant disregard of D.P.R.R. 311.12 (providing in relevant part that a party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall include in her opposition \"a separate, short, and concise statement of the material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried, properly supported by specific reference to the record\"). The appellants did not make the slightest effort to comply with this requirement. Consequently, they must bear the onus of that neglect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rules such as Local Rule 311.12 were developed by the district courts in this circuit in response to this court's concern that, absent such rules, summary judgment practice could too easily become a game of cat-and-mouse, giving rise to the \"specter of district court judges being unfairly sandbagged by unadvertised factual issues.\" Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428311\"><a href=\"/opinion/428311/simion-stepanischen-v-merchants-despatch-transportation-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 931 (1st Cir. 1983). Such rules are a distinct improvement -- and parties ignore them at their peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that spirit, we have held that noncompliance with such a rule, as manifested by a failure to present a statement of disputed facts, embroidered with specific citations to the record, justifies the court's deeming the facts presented in the movant's statement of undisputed facts admitted and ruling accordingly. See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726050\"><a href=\"/opinion/726050/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1398-35-fedrserv3d-395-miguel-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir. 1996); Rivas v. Federacion de Asociaciones Pecuarias, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558570\"><a href=\"/opinion/558570/55-fair-emplpraccas-861-56-empl-prac-dec-p-40659-juan-muller-rivas/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span>, 816 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991); Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533001\"><a href=\"/opinion/533001/elviraida-laracuente-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 1989). We believe that such a disposition would have been wholly appropriate here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Viewed in that light, the appellants' brazen disregard of Local Rule 311.12 constitutes an independently sufficient ground for affirmance of the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth: There is one final, decisive point: to the extent that the appellants' factual proffer might conceivably be thought to support Bivens liability -- and we, like the lower court, do not believe that it does -- their suit names the wrong defendants. It is well settled that a Bivens action will not lie against an agency of the federal government. See FDIC v. Meyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 486 (1994). The same holds true as to federal officials sued in their official capacities. See Affiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v.

A Bivens action only may be brought against federal officials in their individual capacities. Even then, the plaintiff must state a claim for direct rather than vicarious liability; respondeat superior is not a viable theory of Bivens liability. See Bibeau v.

See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763555\"><a href=\"/opinion/763555/grancid-camilo-robles-v-jose-r-zapata-aka-jose-r-zapata-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1999). Be that as it may, supervisory liability exists only where \"(1) there is subordinate liability, and (2) the supervisor's action or inaction was 'affirmatively linked' to the constitutional violation caused by the subordinate.\" Aponte <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197772\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Matos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197772/aponte-matos-v-toledo-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>. Here, the appellants' claims of malfeasance and misfeasance principally involve two relatively low-level DOE staffers, Nter and Rios -- yet neither man is named as a defendant. Assuming arguendo subordinate liability on Nter's and/or Rios's part, the record contains no significantly probative evidence establishing any affirmative link, sufficient to support a finding of culpability, between the actions of which the appellants complain and the persons whom they elected to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. With these modest augmentations, we uphold the judgment below for substantially the reasons stated at greater length by the lower court in its serial opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court ruled, inter alia, that certain audit-related challenges were not ripe for adjudication because the appellants still were pursuing the administrative review process. See Instituto de Educacion Universal Corp. v. Riley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1608717\"><a href=\"/opinion/1608717/instituto-de-educacion-universal-corp-v-riley/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
