Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Roger Witkin with whom Arnold P. Cohen was on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\n   Vicki S. Marani, Department of Justice, with whom Donald K.\r\nStern, United States Attorney, and George W. Vien, Assistant United\r\nStates Attorney, was on brief for the United States.\r\n\nNovember 8, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Darius Hines was charged under a\r\nfourth superceding indictment with possessing and distributing\r\ncocaine base on six specific occasions and conspiracy to do the\r\nsame.  21 U.S.C.  841, 846.  Prior to trial, there were\r\napparently some discussions with the government as to a possible\r\nplea, of which more hereafter, but no agreement was reached.  Four\r\ndays before trial, the government filed an information under 21\r\nU.S.C.  851, setting forth Hines's prior convictions, a necessary\r\npredicate for subjecting him to increased punishment on account of\r\nprior convictions.  See 21 U.S.C.  841(b)(1)(A), 851(a).\r\nTrial began on February 17, 1998.  Both sides presented\r\nopening arguments and the government offered testimony of a key\r\npolice witness.  On the second day of trial, after this witness\r\nconcluded his direct testimony, the parties attempted to negotiate\r\na plea.  The next day, as the trial was about to resume, the\r\ndefendant agreed to plead guilty to all charges and, in exchange,\r\nthe government agreed to withdraw the information under section 851\r\nand to recommend at sentencing a two-level reduction in the\r\ndefendant's offense level for acceptance of responsibility.\r\nThe plea agreement included a provision by which Hines\r\nexplicitly agreed to waive his right to appeal any sentence that\r\ndid not exceed the maximum statutory penalty.  At a plea hearing\r\nconducted on February 19, 1998, the government described the terms\r\nof the plea bargain, including the provision waiving Hines's right\r\nto appeal from the sentence so long as it did not exceed the\r\nstatutory maximum.\r\nThree months later, the court held a sentencing hearing. \r\nHines sought a three-level reduction in his offense level for\r\nacceptance of responsibility; the government supported a two-level\r\nreduction, as promised, but it opposed the third level which is\r\navailable, inter alia, where the defendant otherwise has a criminal\r\noffense level of 16 or higher, qualifies for a two-level reduction\r\nfor acceptance of responsibility, and \"has assisted authorities in\r\nthe investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct\" by taking\r\none or more of the following steps:\r\n  (1) timely providing complete information to\r\nthe government concerning his own involvement\r\nin the offense; or\r\n\n  (2) timely notifying authorities of his\r\nintention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby\r\npermitting the government to avoid preparing\r\nfor trial and permitting the court to allocate\r\nits resources efficiently.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  3E1.1(b) (1997).\r\n\n The district court ruled that Hines was entitled to a\r\ntwo-level but not a three-level reduction; that with that\r\nreduction, Hines was subject under the guidelines to a minimum\r\nsentence of 292 months' imprisonment; that the court was exercising\r\nits discretion to reduce this by 58 months to account for time\r\nserved under state law for related activities, U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c);\r\nand that Hines was therefore sentenced to 234 months' imprisonment. \r\nHines then noticed an appeal and the district court, being reminded\r\nof the waiver, said that the validity of the appeal in light of the\r\nwaiver was a matter for this court.\r\nOn this appeal, the government suggests that we ought not\r\nreach the merits--Hines's claim that he was entitled to the three-\r\nlevel reduction--because his waiver precludes an appeal.  In\r\nresponse, Hines says that, as a matter of public policy, such\r\nwaivers should not be enforced against a defendant and that, in any\r\nevent, his waiver was not knowing or voluntary.  This circuit has\r\nno published opinion that squarely decides whether such waivers are\r\nvalid.  See, e.g., United States v. Springer, 28 F.3d 236, 237 (1st\r\nCir. 1994) (reserving issue).\r\nIn the end, the question may be not \"whether\" waivers are\r\nallowed but when, what kind, upon what explanation, and to what\r\nextent.  Just what purports to be waived, and in what\r\ncircumstances, may vary from case to case; and even the government\r\nconcedes that circuits that have upheld waivers have also marked\r\nout limitations.  E.g., United States v. Schmidt, 47 F.3d 188, 190\r\n(7th Cir. 1995); United States v. Marin, 961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th\r\nCir. 1992).  The issues may be best left to a case where the\r\nasserted waiver would affect our outcome.\r\nIn this case, we have no reason to decide the waiver\r\nissue since the result is the same whether the waiver is given\r\neffect or the merits are resolved.  Nor is this a case in which a\r\nvalid waiver deprives us of \"jurisdiction\" and creates a possible\r\nobjection to bypassing waiver and deciding the merits; this court's\r\njurisdiction to decide a timely appeal from a sentence is\r\nestablished by statute, and the choice among available grounds for\r\ndisposition is a matter for the informed judgment of the court. \r\nCf. United States v. Brundidge, 170 F.3d 1350, 1354 &amp; n.4 (11th\r\nCir. 1999); TI Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 924 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).\r\nAs a predicate, we note that under the guidelines, a\r\nthree-level reduction under section 3E1.1(b)(2) is mandatory if the\r\nstated conditions are met.  United States v. Marroquin, 136 F.3d\r\n220, 223 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255,\r\n1263-64 (1st Cir. 1994).  The only disputed condition in this case\r\nis whether Hines \"timely notif[ied]\" the prosecutor of \"his\r\nintention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the\r\ngovernment to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to\r\nallocate its resources efficiently.\"  U.S.S.G.  3E1.1(b)(2).\r\n  Given the purpose set forth in the \"thereby\" clause,\r\nthe notice of an intent to plead guilty must ordinarily be given\r\nwell before trial.  This is made explicit in the commentary, which\r\nsays that to qualify for the third level reduction, the notice \r\nwill usually occur \"particularly early in the case,\" and must come\r\n\"at a sufficiently early point in the process so that the\r\ngovernment may avoid preparing for trial.\"  U.S.S.G.  3E1.1,\r\ncomment. (n.6).  Our paraphrase of the guideline makes the same\r\npoint.  Marroquin, 136 F.3d at 224.  Here, of course, Hines did not\r\nagree to plead guilty until trial was actually underway and the\r\ngovernment had called one witness and prepared others.\r\nTo this fact, Hines responds that he was ready to plead\r\nguilty well before trial but--according to his counsel's proffer at\r\nsentencing--the government refused to agree to a plea unless a\r\nspecific co-defendant of Hines also pleaded guilty.  The government\r\ndid not directly respond to this proffer and we will assume its\r\naccuracy.  But, of course, the government's consent to a guilty\r\nplea is not required, so what Hines actually means is that the\r\ngovernment would not agree before trial to conferring certain\r\nbenefits within its control, i.e., providing its support for a two-\r\nlevel reduction for acceptance of responsibility and withholding or\r\nwithdrawing the information.\r\nAlthough the guideline language does not nail down the\r\npoint, we think that in general the \"plea of guilty\" it envisages\r\nis an unconditional plea to the indictment, see United States v.\r\nMorillo, 8 F.3d 864, 871-72 (1st Cir. 1993)--unless the government\r\nand defendant agree to some lesser set of offenses, conditions, or\r\nboth, see United States v. Donovan, 996 F.2d 1343, 1345 (1st Cir.\r\n1993) (dicta).  Otherwise, a defendant could offer at the outset to\r\nplead guilty to only one of several offenses or to a lesser offense\r\nand then claim to have satisfied the requirement of \"timely\"\r\nnotice.  Yet this general rule cannot be stated without\r\nqualifications and the sentencing judge is entitled to some\r\nlatitude to cope with variations.\r\nImagine, for example, that a defendant offers to plead to\r\nall counts but one, saying with good cause that this last charge is\r\nunconstitutional, and imagine further that on the eve of trial the\r\njudge agrees, the last count is dismissed, and a guilty plea is\r\ntaken to all other counts.  Or suppose that well before trial the\r\ndefendant admits his guilt on all counts but one, pleads guilty to\r\nall other counts, and is acquitted at trial on the remaining count. \r\nIn both cases, one might argue (we do not decide the outcome) that\r\nthe spirit of the guideline would be satisfied; and, remember that\r\nthe guideline itself does not say \"plea of guilty\" to what.\r\nBut all of this does Hines no good:  he admits that he\r\nwas guilty as charged in the indictment, yet he refused to plead\r\nguilty until trial had begun.  He now suggests that this is because\r\nthe government held over his head the threat of the section 851\r\ninformation; its filing, Hines says, would have meant a mandatory\r\nlife sentence--making acceptance of responsibility meaningless. \r\nHe argues that in these extreme circumstances, the refusal to plead\r\nguilty in advance of trial should not be regarded as inconsistent\r\nwith a full three-level reduction.  Reversing the cliche about\r\nWagner's music, the argument sounds better than it is.\r\n The two-level reduction is for contrition and contrition\r\ncan exist even where, albeit in unusual circumstances, the\r\ndefendant goes to trial.  But the third level is for helping the\r\nauthorities save resources by one of two specified steps--the one\r\nhere at issue is by a pre-trial plea of guilty.  See United States\r\nv. Williams, 86 F.3d 1203, 1206 (D.C. Cir. 1996); United States v.\r\nCovarrubias, 65 F.3d 1362, 1367-68 (7th Cir. 1995).  As already\r\nnoted, there might be some basis for a three-level reduction where\r\nthe defendant resists an early plea to an indictment that is itself\r\noverbroad as to one or more of its charges; but so far as we know,\r\nthere was nothing whatever improper about the section 851\r\ninformation that the government held in reserve, then filed, and\r\nlater withdrew.\r\nThe government's actions in this regard are unexplained,\r\nbut it is quite possible that, until the co-defendant pleaded, the\r\ngovernment held the threat of a mandatory life sentence over\r\nHines's head in order to coerce Hines's cooperation.  These are\r\nrough tactics, but prosecution of drug conspiracies is a rough\r\nbusiness.  In Donovan, we sustained the denial of a three-level\r\nreduction for a defendant who pled guilty on the eve of trial;\r\nthere, too, the defendant said that his offer to plead guilty to\r\nreduced charges had been made earlier but the government had\r\nrefused it to obtain cooperation.  Donovan, 996 F.2d at 1345 n.4. \r\nAt worst, this case is another Donovan.  \r\nAffirmed.\n",

Prior to trial, there were apparently some discussions with the government as to a possible plea, of which more hereafter, but no agreement was reached. Four days before trial, the government filed an information under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851, setting forth Hines's prior convictions, a necessary predicate for subjecting him to increased punishment on account of prior convictions. See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(A), 851(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began on February 17, 1998. Both sides presented opening arguments and the government offered testimony of a key police witness. On the second day of trial, after this witness concluded his direct testimony, the parties attempted to negotiate a plea. The next day, as the trial was about to resume, the defendant agreed to plead guilty to all charges and, in exchange, the government agreed to withdraw the information under section 851 and to recommend at sentencing a two-level reduction in the defendant's offense level for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement included a provision by which Hines explicitly agreed to waive his right to appeal any sentence that did not exceed the maximum statutory penalty. At a plea hearing conducted on February 19, 1998, the government described the terms of the plea bargain, including the provision waiving Hines's right to appeal from the sentence so long as it did not exceed the statutory maximum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three months later, the court held a sentencing hearing. Hines sought a three-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility; the government supported a two-level reduction, as promised, but it opposed the third level which is available, inter alia, where the defendant otherwise has a criminal offense level of 16 or higher, qualifies for a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and \"has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct\" by taking one or more of the following steps:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) timely providing complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b) (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Hines was entitled to a two-level but not a three-level reduction; that with that reduction, Hines was subject under the guidelines to a minimum sentence of 292 months' imprisonment; that the court was exercising its discretion to reduce this by 58 months to account for time served under state law for related activities, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c); and that Hines was therefore sentenced to 234 months' imprisonment. Hines then noticed an appeal and the district court, being reminded of the waiver, said that the validity of the appeal in light of the waiver was a matter for this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, the government suggests that we ought not reach the merits--Hines's claim that he was entitled to the three-level reduction--because his waiver precludes an appeal. In response, Hines says that, as a matter of public policy, such waivers should not be enforced against a defendant and that, in any event, his waiver was not knowing or voluntary. This circuit has no published opinion that squarely decides whether such waivers are valid. See, e.g., United States v. Springer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195470\"><a href=\"/opinion/195470/united-states-v-springer/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 237 (1st Cir. 1994) (reserving issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the question may be not \"whether\" waivers are allowed but when, what kind, upon what explanation, and to what extent. Just what purports to be waived, and in what circumstances, may vary from case to case; and even the government concedes that circuits that have upheld waivers have also marked out limitations. E.g., United States v. Schmidt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"688742\"><a href=\"/opinion/688742/united-states-v-robert-h-schmidt-and-lawrence-b-schmidt/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 190 (7th Cir. 1995); United States v. Marin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581391\"><a href=\"/opinion/581391/united-states-v-herbert-john-marin/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>, 496 (4th Cir. 1992). The issues may be best left to a case where the asserted waiver would affect our outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we have no reason to decide the waiver issue since the result is the same whether the waiver is given effect or the merits are resolved. Nor is this a case in which a valid waiver deprives us of \"jurisdiction\" and creates a possible objection to bypassing waiver and deciding the merits; this court's jurisdiction to decide a timely appeal from a sentence is established by statute, and the choice among available grounds for disposition is a matter for the informed judgment of the court. Cf. United States v. Brundidge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73679\"><a href=\"/opinion/73679/united-states-v-brundidge/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></a></span>, 1354 &amp; n.4 (11th Cir. 1999); TI Fed.

United States v. Marroquin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751617\"><a href=\"/opinion/751617/united-states-v-willy-marroquin-aka-willy-adolfo-marroquin-mendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 223 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v.

The only disputed condition in this case is whether Hines \"timely notif[ied]\" the prosecutor of \"his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the purpose set forth in the \"thereby\" clause, the notice of an intent to plead guilty must ordinarily be given well before trial. This is made explicit in the commentary, which says that to qualify for the third level reduction, the notice will usually occur \"particularly early in the case,\" and must come \"at a sufficiently early point in the process so that the government may avoid preparing for trial.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.6). Our paraphrase of the guideline makes the same point. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751617\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Marroquin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/751617/united-states-v-willy-marroquin-aka-willy-adolfo-marroquin-mendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>. Here, of course, Hines did not agree to plead guilty until trial was actually underway and the government had called one witness and prepared others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this fact, Hines responds that he was ready to plead guilty well before trial but--according to his counsel's proffer at sentencing--the government refused to agree to a plea unless a specific co-defendant of Hines also pleaded guilty. The government did not directly respond to this proffer and we will assume its accuracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But, of course, the government's consent to a guilty plea is not required, so what Hines actually means is that the government would not agree before trial to conferring certain benefits within its control, i.e., providing its support for a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and withholding or withdrawing the information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the guideline language does not nail down the point, we think that in general the \"plea of guilty\" it envisages is an unconditional plea to the indictment, see United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 871-72 (1st Cir. 1993)--unless the government and defendant agree to some lesser set of offenses, conditions, or both, see United States v. Donovan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610557\"><a href=\"/opinion/610557/united-states-v-richard-j-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span>, 1345 (1st Cir. 1993) (dicta). Otherwise, a defendant could offer at the outset to plead guilty to only one of several offenses or to a lesser offense and then claim to have satisfied the requirement of \"timely\" notice. Yet this general rule cannot be stated without qualifications and the sentencing judge is entitled to some latitude to cope with variations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Imagine, for example, that a defendant offers to plead to all counts but one, saying with good cause that this last charge is unconstitutional, and imagine further that on the eve of trial the judge agrees, the last count is dismissed, and a guilty plea is taken to all other counts. Or suppose that well before trial the defendant admits his guilt on all counts but one, pleads guilty to all other counts, and is acquitted at trial on the remaining count. In both cases, one might argue (we do not decide the outcome) that the spirit of the guideline would be satisfied; and, remember that the guideline itself does not say \"plea of guilty\" to what.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But all of this does Hines no good: he admits that he was guilty as charged in the indictment, yet he refused to plead guilty until trial had begun. He now suggests that this is because the government held over his head the threat of the section 851 information; its filing, Hines says, would have meant a mandatory life sentence--making acceptance of responsibility meaningless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He argues that in these extreme circumstances, the refusal to plead guilty in advance of trial should not be regarded as inconsistent with a full three-level reduction. Reversing the cliche about Wagner's music, the argument sounds better than it is.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two-level reduction is for contrition and contrition can exist even where, albeit in unusual circumstances, the defendant goes to trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> But the third level is for helping the authorities save resources by one of two specified steps--the one here at issue is by a pre-trial plea of guilty. See United States v. Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720523\"><a href=\"/opinion/720523/united-states-v-paul-williams-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1203</span></a></span>, 1206 (D.C. Cir. 1996); United States v. Covarrubias, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"704013\"><a href=\"/opinion/704013/united-states-v-jesus-s-covarrubias-and-graciela-covarrubias/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1362</span></a></span>, 1367-68 (7th Cir. 1995). As already noted, there might be some basis for a three-level reduction where the defendant resists an early plea to an indictment that is itself overbroad as to one or more of its charges; but so far as we know, there was nothing whatever improper about the section 851 information that the government held in reserve, then filed, and later withdrew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's actions in this regard are unexplained, but it is quite possible that, until the co-defendant pleaded, the government held the threat of a mandatory life sentence over Hines's head in order to coerce Hines's cooperation. These are rough tactics, but prosecution of drug conspiracies is a rough business. In Donovan, we sustained the denial of a three-level reduction for a defendant who pled guilty on the eve of trial; there, too, the defendant said that his offer to plead guilty to reduced charges had been made earlier but the government had refused it to obtain cooperation. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610557\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Donovan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/610557/united-states-v-richard-j-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1345</span> </a></span>n.4.
