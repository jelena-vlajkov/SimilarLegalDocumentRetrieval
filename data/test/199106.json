This appeal poses a single\n\nquestion:         Do the safeguards demanded by Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n\nU.S.       436   (1966),   apply    to   testimony    given      by    a   subpoenaed\n\nwitness in a criminal proceeding?                 The district court answered\n\nthis query in the affirmative and suppressed certain inculpatory\n\nstatements made by Tomás Meléndez Sánchez (Meléndez) on the\n\nground that Meléndez had not been informed of his Miranda rights\n\nbefore he testified.             See United States v. Sánchez, 59 F. Supp.\n\n2d 348, 354 (D.P.R. 1999).1              Concluding, as we do, that Miranda\n\ndoes not apply to in-court testimony, we reverse.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n                 In December 1997, Meléndez appeared before a federal\n\ngrand jury and testified under oath as to the involvement of\n\nseveral individuals in an armored car robbery.                        In response to\n\nthis evidence, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment\n\nthat       re-charged      the    original      suspects   and    added      two   new\n\ndefendants.         Meléndez thereafter experienced a change of heart:\n\n\n\n       1\n     Due to a publisher's error, the lower court opinion has\nbeen reported as \"United States v. Sánchez\" rather than \"United\nStates v. Meléndez.\" To avoid further confusion, we cite to it\nsimply as \"D. Ct. Op.\"\n\n                                          -2-\n\fin March 1998, he met with counsel for one of the individuals he\n\nhad implicated and retracted his allegations.             The lawyer then\n\nmoved to dismiss the charges against his client.\n\n            The case was set for trial on May 19, 1998.           Prior to\n\ngoing     forward,   Judge   Fusté    held   an   evidentiary   hearing   to\n\nconsider the motion to dismiss.              The defense called Meléndez\n\n(who had been subpoenaed by the government to testify at the\n\ntrial) as its only witness.          Meléndez appeared without counsel.\n\nOn direct examination by the moving defendant's attorney, he\n\nasserted that an FBI agent had supplied him with, and coached\n\nhim on, the fabricated story that he had related to the grand\n\njury. 2    On examination by a lawyer for a different defendant,\n\nMeléndez acknowledged dissembling to the grand jury.             On cross-\n\nexamination by an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA), he\n\nreiterated and embellished upon these admissions.\n\n            Following an exchange with the AUSA in which Meléndez\n\nconceded that he had lied \"for money,\" Judge Fusté warned him\n\nthat anything he said could be used against him in a separate\n\nprosecution and also advised him that he was entitled to a\n\nlawyer then and there.         Meléndez disclaimed any need for an\n\n\n     2\n     The persons charged with having perpetrated the armored car\nrobbery attempted to introduce Meléndez's tale at their trial.\nThe district court excluded the proffer, and we upheld that\nruling.  See United States v. Mojica-Baez, ___ F.3d ___, ___\n(1st Cir. 2000) [No. 98-2349, slip op. at 16-19].\n\n                                      -3-\n\fattorney and continued to testify.       When he finished, the court\n\nordered his immediate arrest.        An indictment for making false\n\ndeclarations in the course of a judicial proceeding followed\n\napace.    See   18 U.S.C. § 1623.\n\n           Transformed from a witness to a defendant, Meléndez\n\ninvoked Miranda, the watershed case in which the Supreme Court\n\nheld that a person undergoing custodial interrogation first must\n\nbe told that he has the right to remain silent; that any\n\nstatement he makes may be used as evidence against him; that he\n\nhas a right to an attorney; and that if he cannot afford an\n\nattorney, one will be appointed for him.         See 384 U.S. at 444.\n\nNoting that his testimony at the May 19 hearing had not been\n\npreceded by any warnings, Meléndez moved to bar the government\n\nfrom using it in the case against him.\n\n           His argument fell on sympathetic ears.       Reasoning that\n\nthe in-court questioning constituted custodial interrogation for\n\nwhich    Miranda   warnings   were   required,   the   district   court\n\nsuppressed all the statements that Meléndez had made prior to\n\nJudge Fusté's admonition concerning self-incrimination and the\n\nright to counsel.     See D. Ct. Op., 59 F. Supp. 2d at 354.      This\n\ninterlocutory appeal followed.       We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3731.     See United States v. Flemmi, ___ F.3d ___,\n\n___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 99-2292, slip op. at 8-11] (describing\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fscope and operation of statute allowing certain interlocutory\n\nappeals by the government in criminal cases); United States v.\n\nBrooks, 145 F.3d 446, 453-54 (1st Cir. 1998) (similar).\n\n\n\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            This appeal presents a pure question of law concerning\n\nthe   district    court's    application       of   the    Miranda        rule.\n\nAccordingly, we afford de novo review.              See United States v.\n\nLewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1332-33 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Miranda   established     a    bright-line    rule   making    the\n\nwarnings,    enumerated     above,     conditions     precedent      to     the\n\nadmissibility of statements uttered by a suspect during the\n\ncourse of custodial interrogation.           See 384 U.S. at 444.          That\n\nrule is one of constitutional dimension.                 See Dickerson v.\n\nUnited States, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 2333-34 (2000).                  Withal, it\n\napplies only to custodial interrogations.                 See Berkemer v.\n\nMcCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 428-30 (1984); see also Dickerson, 120 S.\n\nCt. at 2331; Miranda, 384 U.S. at 467.          This is as it should be:\n\nin a custodial interrogation, the police have the capacity to\n\ndominate the scene to such an extent that the risks of coercion\n\nand intimidation are unreasonably high.          The rule was devised to\n\nprotect against the extraordinary danger of compelled self-\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fincrimination that is inherent in such situations.               See Miranda,\n\n384 U.S. at 455-56.           Outside that narrow context, however,\n\nMiranda has no force.         See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420,\n\n430 (1984).\n\n          Viewed against this backdrop, the threshold question\n\nhere is whether the in-court questioning of Meléndez can be said\n\nto constitute custodial interrogation.            The court below thought\n\nthat it could.        See D. Ct. Op., 59 F. Supp. 2d at 354.            We do\n\nnot agree.    We set out below four reasons why we consider in-\n\ncourt testimony to be beyond Miranda's reach.\n\n          First       and   foremost,    interrogation     in    a   courtroom\n\nsetting simply does not present the dangers that the Miranda\n\nCourt   sought   to    mitigate.        The   Court   defined    a   custodial\n\ninterrogation     as    \"questioning     initiated    by   law   enforcement\n\nofficers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise\n\ndeprived of his freedom of action in a[] significant way.\"\n\nMiranda, 384 U.S. at 444.       In framing this definition, the Court\n\nrepeatedly emphasized that the safeguards it envisioned were\n\ndesigned to apply to self-incriminating statements obtained\n\nduring \"incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-\n\ndominated atmosphere.\"         Id. at 445.       The Court took pains to\n\ndistinguish that sort of milieu from \"courts or other official\n\ninvestigations, where there are often impartial observers to\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fguard against intimidation or trickery.\"       Id. at 461.    Although\n\nthis was dictum, the Court hardly could have sent a clearer\n\nsignal.\n\n          Moreover, the underlying distinction makes sense.           The\n\ndangers   of   coerced    self-incrimination   present   in   a    police\n\ninterrogation — a unique potential for the exertion of pressure,\n\nphysical intimidation, psychological trickery, and prolonged\n\ngrilling with no outside contact — are largely absent in a\n\npublic courtroom.        As written, the Miranda rule balances the\n\nneed to investigate and prosecute crimes against the imperatives\n\nof the Fifth Amendment.       See Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433,\n\n443 (1974).     To apply the rule willy-nilly to so different a\n\nsituation would destroy this delicate balance.            We decline\n\nMeléndez's invitation to fish in such troubled waters.                See\n\nBerkemer, 468 U.S. at 437 (\"Fidelity to the doctrine announced\n\nin Miranda requires that it be enforced strictly, but only in\n\nthose types of situations in which the concerns that powered the\n\ndecision are implicated.\").\n\n          Our second reason for holding Miranda inapposite has\n\nits roots in this court's precedents.       We previously indicated\n\nthat Miranda's safeguards do not extend to courtroom testimony.\n\nIn United States v. Byram, 145 F.3d 405 (1st Cir. 1998), we\n\nrejected the suggestion that a witness must receive               Miranda\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fwarnings prior to courtroom testimony to render that testimony\n\nadmissible against him in a subsequent prosecution.              See id. at\n\n409.       We observed that \"the testimony was given in open court\n\nand involved none of the dangers of jail-cell interrogation that\n\nprompted      Miranda.\"    Id.      Although    our   comments    in   Byram\n\ntechnically are dictum — we ultimately suppressed Byram's prior\n\ntestimony on the unrelated ground that it had been tainted by an\n\nearlier statement obtained in violation of Miranda, see id. at\n\n410 — they are considered dictum, and thus persuasive (even\n\nthough not binding).3\n\n              Third, the case law in the other courts of appeals\n\ncomports with our thinking.         For example, in United States v.\n\nValdez, 16 F.3d 1324 (2d Cir. 1994), the court held a witness's\n\ntrial testimony admissible in a later perjury prosecution, even\n\nthough the presiding judge (who delayed the execution of a\n\nwarrant for the witness's arrest so that he could testify) had\n\nnot warned the witness of the possible consequences of his\n\ntestimony.      See id. at 1330-32.       Similarly, in United States v.\n\nKilgroe, 959 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1992), a witness testified under\n\nsubpoena,       without   Miranda    warnings,    and    the     government\n\n\n       3\n     The force of the Byram dictum is strengthened by our\nearlier decision in Labbe v. Berman, 621 F.2d 26 (1st Cir.\n1980), in which we upheld the admission of a witness's inquest\ntestimony at his subsequent trial, notwithstanding the absence\nof Miranda warnings. See id. at 29.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthereafter           used       the   testimony      against       him   in    a    subsequent\n\nprosecution.            See id. at 803.           The Ninth Circuit sanctioned the\n\nadmissibility of the evidence, stating that \"the courtroom . .\n\n.   is       not    the    type       of   setting    that    would      justify         invoking\n\nMiranda's prophylactic rule.\"                     Id. at 804 (footnote omitted).4\n\n                   Last — but surely not least — the Supreme Court has\n\nrefused to require that a grand jury witness receive Miranda-\n\nlike         warnings      as    a    condition      precedent      to   the       use    of   his\n\ntestimony against him in a later perjury prosecution.5                                         See\n\nUnited States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564, 580 (1976) (plurality\n\nopinion).            In declining to require such                   warnings, the Court\n\nnoted the many differences between custodial interrogation and\n\nother types of official investigations.                        See id. at 579-80.              The\n\nyear         after    it    decided        Mandujano,        the    Court      held       that   a\n\n\n\n         4\n     Interestingly, the Kilgroe court rejected an assertion that\nthe subpoena served upon the witness-turned-defendant created a\ncompulsion to give incriminating testimony, remarking that being\nsubpoenaed gave the witness the opportunity to obtain counsel\nand left him free to refuse to answer questions that would\nincriminate him.    See 959 F.2d at 804-05.     We endorse this\nrationale, noting, inter alia, that the witness-turned-defendant\nin Byram also was under subpoena when he gave his original\ntestimony. See 145 F.3d at 409.\n         5\n      We say \" Miranda-like\" because the precise warnings required\nby Miranda are not fully transferable to the grand jury setting.\nIn that milieu, a witness does not have \"the right to remain\nsilent,\" but can in fact be compelled to answer all but self-\nincriminating questions. See United States v. Washington, 431\nU.S. 181, 183 n.2 (1977).\n\n                                               -9-\n\fdefendant's statements to a grand jury were admissible against\n\nher in a later perjury prosecution even though she had not been\n\neffectively     warned   of   her   Fifth     Amendment   right   not   to\n\nincriminate herself.     See United States v. Wong, 431 U.S. 174,\n\n177-79 (1977).    The Byram court thought that the analogy between\n\ngrand jury testimony and in-court testimony was compelling, see\n\n145 F.3d at 409, and so do we.\n\n           In short, logic and an unbroken skein of authority —\n\nour own case law, cogent opinions from sister circuits, and\n\nanalogous Supreme Court precedent — point unerringly to the\n\nconclusion that self-incriminating statements made by witnesses\n\n(whether   or   not   subpoenaed)     while    testifying   in    judicial\n\nproceedings are admissible against them in later prosecutions,\n\nnotwithstanding the absence of Miranda warnings.            We so hold.6\n\n\n    6In making a contrary determination, the court below relied\non four factors that we have indicated should be taken into\naccount in determining whether particular police questioning is\ncustodial in nature. See D. Ct. Op., 59 F. Supp. 2d at 351-54\n(citing, inter alia, United States v. Ventura, 85 F.3d 708, 711\n(1st Cir. 1996)).    These factors include the nature of the\nsurroundings in which the suspect is questioned; the number of\nlaw enforcement officers present; the degree of physical\nrestraint placed upon the subject; and the duration and\ncharacter of the interrogation. See id. at 351-52. This put\nthe cart before the horse. Where, as here, questioning is done\nby lawyers in an open courtroom, the Ventura mode of analysis\ndoes not come into play.     Outside the context of custodial\ninterrogation, the more relevant rule is that a witness must\nseize the initiative in claiming the privilege against self-\ninculpation — and this holds true even if he is confronted with\nqueries that the government reasonably may expect will elicit\n\n                                    -10-\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.       Because we are convinced that\n\nthe dangers that animated Miranda do not exist in situations\n\ninvolving     in-court    testimony,      we     rule      that    Meléndez's\n\ntestimonial     statements       are     admissible          against        him,\n\nnotwithstanding     the   fact   that    he    was   not    warned     of    his\n\nconstitutional rights before he began to testify.                 We therefore\n\nreverse the district court's contrary determination.                   We add,\n\nhowever, that while Miranda warnings are not necessary to ensure\n\nthat statements made by witnesses testifying in open court may\n\nbe used against them in future prosecutions, it nonetheless may\n\nbe salutary in a particular case for a judge to issue warnings,\n\nor even to appoint counsel, if a witness appears likely to\n\nincriminate    herself.    Still,      this    practice    entails     certain\n\nrisks, see Valdez, 16 F.3d at 1331, and we leave its employment\n\nto the sound discretion of the district courts.\n\n\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\nincriminating answers.

Accordingly, we afford de novo review. See United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1332-33 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miranda established a bright-line rule making the warnings, enumerated above, conditions precedent to the admissibility of statements uttered by a suspect during the course of custodial interrogation. See 384 U.S. at 444. That rule is one of constitutional dimension. See Dickerson v. United States, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 2333-34 (2000). Withal, it applies only to custodial interrogations. See Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 428-30 (1984); see also Dickerson, 120 S. Ct. at 2331; Miranda, 384 U.S. at 467. This is as it should be: in a custodial interrogation, the police have the capacity to dominate the scene to such an extent that the risks of coercion and intimidation are unreasonably high. The rule was devised to protect against the extraordinary danger of compelled self-incrimination that is inherent in such situations. See Miranda, 384 U.S. at 455-56. Outside that narrow context, however, Miranda has no force. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 430 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, the threshold question here is whether the in-court questioning of Melndez can be said to constitute custodial interrogation. The court below thought that it could. See D. Ct. Op., 59 F. Supp. 2d at 354. We do not agree. We set out below four reasons why we consider in-court testimony to be beyond Miranda's reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and foremost, interrogation in a courtroom setting simply does not present the dangers that the Miranda Court sought to mitigate. The Court defined a custodial interrogation as \"questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in a[] significant way.\" Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444. In framing this definition, the Court repeatedly emphasized that the safeguards it envisioned were designed to apply to self-incriminating statements obtained during \"incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere.\" Id. at 445. The Court took pains to distinguish that sort of milieu from \"courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.\" Id. at 461. Although this was dictum, the Court hardly could have sent a clearer signal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the underlying distinction makes sense. The dangers of coerced self-incrimination present in a police interrogation -- a unique potential for the exertion of pressure, physical intimidation, psychological trickery, and prolonged grilling with no outside contact -- are largely absent in a public courtroom. As written, the Miranda rule balances the need to investigate and prosecute crimes against the imperatives of the Fifth Amendment. See Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433, 443 (1974). To apply the rule willy-nilly to so different a situation would destroy this delicate balance. We decline Melndez's invitation to fish in such troubled waters. See Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 437 (\"Fidelity to the doctrine announced in Miranda requires that it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our second reason for holding Miranda inapposite has its roots in this court's precedents. We previously indicated that Miranda's safeguards do not extend to courtroom testimony. In United States v. Byram, 145 F.3d 405 (1st Cir. 1998), we rejected the suggestion that a witness must receive Miranda warnings prior to courtroom testimony to render that testimony admissible against him in a subsequent prosecution. See id. at 409. We observed that \"the testimony was given in open court and involved none of the dangers of jail-cell interrogation that prompted Miranda.\" Id. Although our comments in Byram technically are dictum -- we ultimately suppressed Byram's prior testimony on the unrelated ground that it had been tainted by an earlier statement obtained in violation of Miranda, see id. at 410 -- they are considered dictum, and thus persuasive (even though not binding).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the case law in the other courts of appeals comports with our thinking. For example, in United States v. Valdez, 16 F.3d 1324 (2d Cir. 1994), the court held a witness's trial testimony admissible in a later perjury prosecution, even though the presiding judge (who delayed the execution of a warrant for the witness's arrest so that he could testify) had not warned the witness of the possible consequences of his testimony. See id. at 1330-32. Similarly, in United States v. Kilgroe, 959 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1992), a witness testified under subpoena, without Miranda warnings, and the government thereafter used the testimony against him in a subsequent prosecution. See id. at 803. The Ninth Circuit sanctioned the admissibility of the evidence, stating that \"the courtroom . . . is not the type of setting that would justify invoking Miranda's prophylactic rule.\" Id. at 804 (footnote omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last -- but surely not least -- the Supreme Court has refused to require that a grand jury witness receive Miranda-like warnings as a condition precedent to the use of his testimony against him in a later perjury prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564, 580 (1976) (plurality opinion). In declining to require such warnings, the Court noted the many differences between custodial interrogation and other types of official investigations. See id. at 579-80. The year after it decided Mandujano, the Court held that a defendant's statements to a grand jury were admissible against her in a later perjury prosecution even though she had not been effectively warned of her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself. See United States v. Wong, 431 U.S. 174, 177-79 (1977). The Byram court thought that the analogy between grand jury testimony and in-court testimony was compelling, see 145 F.3d at 409, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, logic and an unbroken skein of authority -- our own case law, cogent opinions from sister circuits, and analogous Supreme Court precedent -- point unerringly to the conclusion that self-incriminating statements made by witnesses (whether or not subpoenaed) while testifying in judicial proceedings are admissible against them in later prosecutions, notwithstanding the absence of Miranda warnings. We so hold.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because we are convinced that the dangers that animated Miranda do not exist in situations involving in-court testimony, we rule that Melndez's testimonial statements are admissible against him, notwithstanding the fact that he was not warned of his constitutional rights before he began to testify. We therefore reverse the district court's contrary determination. We add, however, that while Miranda warnings are not necessary to ensure that statements made by witnesses testifying in open court may be used against them in future prosecutions, it nonetheless may be salutary in a particular case for a judge to issue warnings, or even to appoint counsel, if a witness appears likely to incriminate herself. Still, this practice entails certain risks, see Valdez, 16 F.3d at 1331, and we leave its employment to the sound discretion of the district courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Due to a publisher's error, the lower court opinion has been reported as \"United States v.

The district court excluded the proffer, and we upheld that ruling. See United States v. Mojica-Baez, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 98-2349, slip op. at 16-19].</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The force of the Byram dictum is strengthened by our earlier decision in Labbe v. Berman, 621 F.2d 26 (1st Cir. 1980), in which we upheld the admission of a witness's inquest testimony at his subsequent trial, notwithstanding the absence of Miranda warnings. See id. at 29.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Interestingly, the Kilgroe court rejected an assertion that the subpoena served upon the witness-turned-defendant created a compulsion to give incriminating testimony, remarking that being subpoenaed gave the witness the opportunity to obtain counsel and left him free to refuse to answer questions that would incriminate him. See 959 F.2d at 804-05. We endorse this rationale, noting, inter alia, that the witness-turned-defendant in Byram also was under subpoena when he gave his original testimony. See 145 F.3d at 409.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We say \"Miranda-like\" because the precise warnings required by Miranda are not fully transferable to the grand jury setting. In that milieu, a witness does not have \"the right to remain silent,\" but can in fact be compelled to answer all but self-incriminating questions. See United States v. Washington, 431 U.S. 181, 183 n.2 (1977).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In making a contrary determination, the court below relied on four factors that we have indicated should be taken into account in determining whether particular police questioning is custodial in nature. See D. Ct. Op., 59 F. Supp. 2d at 351-54 (citing, inter alia, United States v. Ventura, 85 F.3d 708, 711 (1st Cir. 1996)). These factors include the nature of the surroundings in which the suspect is questioned; the number of law enforcement officers present; the degree of physical restraint placed upon the subject; and the duration and character of the interrogation. See id. at 351-52. This put the cart before the horse. Where, as here, questioning is done by lawyers in an open courtroom, the Ventura mode of analysis does not come into play. Outside the context of custodial interrogation, the more relevant rule is that a witness must seize the initiative in claiming the privilege against self-inculpation -- and this holds true even if he is confronted with queries that the government reasonably may expect will elicit incriminating answers.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1997, Melndez appeared before a federal grand jury and testified under oath as to the involvement of several individuals in an armored car robbery. In response to this evidence, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment that re-charged the original suspects and added two new defendants. Melndez thereafter experienced a change of heart: in March 1998, he met with counsel for one of the individuals he had implicated and retracted his allegations.

In framing this definition, the Court repeatedly emphasized that the safeguards it envisioned were designed to apply to self-incriminating statements obtained during \"incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 445. </a></span>The Court took pains to distinguish that sort of milieu from \"courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 461. </a></span>Although this was dictum, the Court hardly could have sent a clearer signal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the underlying distinction makes sense. The dangers of coerced self-incrimination present in a police interrogation -- a unique potential for the exertion of pressure, physical intimidation, psychological trickery, and prolonged grilling with no outside contact -- are largely absent in a public courtroom. As written, the Miranda rule balances the need to investigate and prosecute crimes against the imperatives of the Fifth Amendment. See Michigan v. Tucker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109063\"><a href=\"/opinion/109063/michigan-v-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span>, 443 (1974). To apply the rule willy-nilly to so different a situation would destroy this delicate balance. We decline Melndez's invitation to fish in such troubled waters. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Berkemer,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">437</span> </a></span>(\"Fidelity to the doctrine announced in Miranda requires that it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our second reason for holding Miranda inapposite has its roots in this court's precedents. We previously indicated that Miranda's safeguards do not extend to courtroom testimony. In United States v. Byram, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197962\"><a href=\"/opinion/197962/united-states-v-byram/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1998), we rejected the suggestion that a witness must receive Miranda warnings prior to courtroom testimony to render that testimony admissible against him in a subsequent prosecution. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197962\"><a href=\"/opinion/197962/united-states-v-byram/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 409. </a></span>We observed that \"the testimony was given in open court and involved none of the dangers of jail-cell interrogation that prompted Miranda.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197962\"><a href=\"/opinion/197962/united-states-v-byram/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Although our </a></span>comments in Byram technically are dictum -- we ultimately suppressed Byram's prior testimony on the unrelated ground that it had been tainted by an earlier statement obtained in violation of Miranda, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197962\"><a href=\"/opinion/197962/united-states-v-byram/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 410 </a></span>-- they are considered dictum, and thus persuasive (even though not binding).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the case law in the other courts of appeals comports with our thinking. For example, in United States v. Valdez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663697\"><a href=\"/opinion/663697/united-states-v-pedro-h-valdez-wasang-tomas-mock-jorge-garcia-and-raul/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1324</span> </a></span>(2d Cir. 1994), the court held a witness's trial testimony admissible in a later perjury prosecution, even though the presiding judge (who delayed the execution of a warrant for the witness's arrest so that he could testify) had not warned the witness of the possible consequences of his testimony. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663697\"><a href=\"/opinion/663697/united-states-v-pedro-h-valdez-wasang-tomas-mock-jorge-garcia-and-raul/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1330-32. </a></span>Similarly, in United States v. Kilgroe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580016\"><a href=\"/opinion/580016/united-states-v-john-f-kilgroe-and-jesse-ridings/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span> </a></span>(9th Cir. 1992), a witness testified under subpoena, without Miranda warnings, and the government thereafter used the testimony against him in a subsequent prosecution. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580016\"><a href=\"/opinion/580016/united-states-v-john-f-kilgroe-and-jesse-ridings/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 803. </a></span>The Ninth Circuit sanctioned the admissibility of the evidence, stating that \"the courtroom . . . is not the type of setting that would justify invoking Miranda's prophylactic rule.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580016\"><a href=\"/opinion/580016/united-states-v-john-f-kilgroe-and-jesse-ridings/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 804 </a></span>(footnote omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last -- but surely not least -- the Supreme Court has refused to require that a grand jury witness receive Miranda-like warnings as a condition precedent to the use of his testimony against him in a later perjury prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See United States v. Mandujano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109442\"><a href=\"/opinion/109442/united-states-v-mandujano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 580 (1976) (plurality opinion). In declining to require such warnings, the Court noted the many differences between custodial interrogation and other types of official investigations. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109442\"><a href=\"/opinion/109442/united-states-v-mandujano/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 579-80. </a></span>The year after it decided Mandujano, the Court held that a defendant's statements to a grand jury were admissible against her in a later perjury prosecution even though she had not been effectively warned of her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself. See United States v. Wong, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109658\"><a href=\"/opinion/109658/united-states-v-wong/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 177-79 (1977). The Byram court thought that the analogy between grand jury testimony and in-court testimony was compelling, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> <span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">409</span></span>, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, logic and an unbroken skein of authority -- our own case law, cogent opinions from sister circuits, and analogous Supreme Court precedent -- point unerringly to the conclusion that self-incriminating statements made by witnesses (whether or not subpoenaed) while testifying in judicial proceedings are admissible against them in later prosecutions, notwithstanding the absence of Miranda warnings. We so hold.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because we are convinced that the dangers that animated Miranda do not exist in situations involving in-court testimony, we rule that Melndez's testimonial statements are admissible against him, notwithstanding the fact that he was not warned of his constitutional rights before he began to testify. We therefore reverse the district court's contrary determination. We add, however, that while Miranda warnings are not necessary to ensure that statements made by witnesses testifying in open court may be used against them in future prosecutions, it nonetheless may be salutary in a particular case for a judge to issue warnings, or even to appoint counsel, if a witness appears likely to incriminate herself. Still, this practice entails certain risks, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663697\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Valdez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/663697/united-states-v-pedro-h-valdez-wasang-tomas-mock-jorge-garcia-and-raul/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, and we leave its employment to the sound discretion of the district courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Due to a publisher's error, the lower court opinion has been reported as \"United States v. Snchez\" rather than \"United States v. Melndez.\" To avoid further confusion, we cite to it simply as \"D. Ct. Op.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The persons charged with having perpetrated the armored car robbery attempted to introduce Melndez's tale at their trial. The district court excluded the proffer, and we upheld that ruling. See United States v. Mojica-Baez, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 98-2349, slip op. at 16-19].</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The force of the Byram dictum is strengthened by our earlier decision in Labbe v. Berman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377950\"><a href=\"/opinion/377950/russell-g-labbe-sr-v-louis-m-berman-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1980), in which we upheld the admission of a witness's inquest testimony at his subsequent trial, notwithstanding the absence of Miranda warnings. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377950\"><a href=\"/opinion/377950/russell-g-labbe-sr-v-louis-m-berman-etc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 29.</a></span></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Interestingly, the Kilgroe court rejected an assertion that the subpoena served upon the witness-turned-defendant created a compulsion to give incriminating testimony, remarking that being subpoenaed gave the witness the opportunity to obtain counsel and left him free to refuse to answer questions that would incriminate him. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580016\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/580016/united-states-v-john-f-kilgroe-and-jesse-ridings/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">804-05</span></a></span>. We endorse this rationale, noting, inter alia, that the witness-turned-defendant in Byram also was under subpoena when he gave his original testimony. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">409</span></span>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We say \"Miranda-like\" because the precise warnings required by Miranda are not fully transferable to the grand jury setting. In that milieu, a witness does not have \"the right to remain silent,\" but can in fact be compelled to answer all but self-incriminating questions. See United States v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109659\"><a href=\"/opinion/109659/united-states-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>, 183 n.2 (1977).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In making a contrary determination, the court below relied on four factors that we have indicated should be taken into account in determining whether particular police questioning is custodial in nature. See D. Ct. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2408467\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Op.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2408467/united-states-v-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">351-54</span> </a></span>(citing, inter alia, United States v. Ventura, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196786\"><a href=\"/opinion/196786/united-states-v-fernandez-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 711 (1st Cir. 1996)). These factors include the nature of the surroundings in which the suspect is questioned; the number of law enforcement officers present; the degree of physical restraint placed upon the subject; and the duration and character of the interrogation. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196786\"><a href=\"/opinion/196786/united-states-v-fernandez-ventura/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 351-52. </a></span>This put the cart before the horse. Where, as here, questioning is done by lawyers in an open courtroom, the Ventura mode of analysis does not come into play. Outside the context of custodial interrogation, the more relevant rule is that a witness must seize the initiative in claiming the privilege against self-inculpation -- and this holds true even if he is confronted with queries that the government reasonably may expect will elicit incriminating answers. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Murphy,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span>.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
