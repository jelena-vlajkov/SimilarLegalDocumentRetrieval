On appeal defendant-\r\nappellant Murad Skin Research Laboratories, Inc. (\"Murad\")\r\nchallenges the verdict rendered in favor of both plaintiffs IRG\r\nRESEARCH GROUP, INC. (\"IRG\") and Ileana Irvine (\"Irvine\").\r\nSpecifically, Murad alleges that the district court erred by (1)\r\nnot granting its motion for judgment as a matter of law; (2)\r\ndeclining to charge the jury in accordance with its proffered\r\ninstruction on foreseeability; (3) denying its petition for a new\r\ntrial; and (4) allowing the testimony of plaintiffs' expert\r\nwitness.\r\nOn review we agree with Murad's reasoning that it is\r\nentitled to a new trial vis--vis IRG, and that Irvine's individual\r\nclaim should have been dismissed as a matter of law.\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\nMurad is a stateside manufacturer of skin care products. \r\nIrvine and her daughter, Catherine Irvine Sarnataro, both\r\n\"aestheticians,\" i.e. skin care specialists, first came in contact\r\nwith the Murad line of products at a trade show in Chicago in 1989. \r\nIrvine testified at trial that there was a \"glycolic acid\r\nrevolution\" in the industry at the time and she found the glycolic\r\nacid manufactured by Murad to be the \"most effective\" of all the\r\nother products available in the market.  Initially, she purchased\r\nMurad products for her own clients but since 1991 she also sold\r\nthem to various salons.\r\nSubsequently, Irvine and her daughter met periodically\r\nwith Dr. Howard Murad, president of Murad, at various conferences\r\nand conveyed to him an interest in becoming the exclusive\r\ndistributor of Murad products in Puerto Rico.  The conversations\r\nculminated in a provisional exclusive distribution agreement dated\r\nSeptember 2, 1993 with IRG, a corporation established and\r\ncontrolled by Irvine and her daughter.  The contract would be\r\nextended after December 1994 conditioned upon IRG meeting certain\r\nsales quotas.\r\nBoth Irvine and her daughter testified regarding their\r\nefforts on behalf of IRG to develop a market for the Murad skin\r\nproducts in Puerto Rico which included promotions, advertisements,\r\ndemonstrations, training and education of both aestheticians and\r\ndermatologists.  IRG operated through its own clinics and also sold\r\nto aestheticians and medical offices.\r\nIn May 1994 Murad broadcast an infomercial on various\r\nstateside cable television stations as part of its advertising\r\ncampaign.  Dr. Murad testified that the purpose behind the\r\ninfomercial was to expose their home products to customers and also\r\nto lure them into the salons for professional treatment.  Unbeknown\r\nto Murad, a New York station relayed the infomercial to Puerto Rico\r\nand its products were thereby made available locally through\r\ntelemarketing.\r\nAccording to plaintiffs-appellees, the infomercial marked\r\nthe beginning of the economic downfall of both IRG and Irvine. \r\nAfter IRG learned of the telemarketing incursion, it sought relief\r\nunder the Puerto Rico Distributorship Act, Law 75 of June 24, 1964,\r\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10  278 et seq. (1997) whereas Irvine sued\r\nunder the local torts statute.  The jury found for plaintiffs-\r\nappellees and awarded $390,000 to IRG and $100,000 to Irvine as\r\ndamages.\r\n                           RULE 50\r\nPetitions for judgments as a matter of law under Rule\r\n50(a)(1) Fed. R. Civ. P. will be granted only in those instances\r\nwhere, after having examined the evidence as well as all\r\npermissible inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable\r\nto non-movant, the court finds that a reasonable jury could not\r\nrender a verdict in that party's favor.

A new trial is\r\nwarranted only in those situations where the verdict is contrary to\r\nthe clear weight of the evidence introduced at trial and its\r\nratification would result in a miscarriage of justice.

The statute was initially enacted to\r\navoid the inequity of arbitrary termination of distribution\r\nrelationships once the designated dealer had successfully developed\r\na local market for the principal's products and/or services. \r\nSheils Title Co., 184 F.3d at 14; Euromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N.\r\nAm., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 870 (1st Cir. 1998); Borschow Hosp. and\r\nMed. Supplies, Inc. v. Csar Castillo, Inc., 96 F.3d 10, 14 (1st\r\nCir. 1996); R.W. Intern. Corp. v. Welch Foods, Inc., 88 F.3d 49, 51\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  In order to accomplish its goal Law 75 limited\r\nthe principal's ability to end the relationship unilaterally except\r\nfor \"just cause,\"  278a, while subjecting the principal to \r\nconsiderable economic liability for unjustifiable terminations. \r\nSee  278b of Law 75 (enumerating factors to consider in\r\ncalculating award).\r\nIn 1966 the protection afforded to dealers under Law 75\r\nwas extended to include the conduct of a principal which even\r\nthough it did not end the contract it was deemed detrimental to\r\nthe distribution relationship.  The amendment further provided that\r\nimpairments without just cause would subject the infringing party\r\nto the same liability provided for terminations under  278b.\r\n                          Impairment\r\nLaw 75 enumerates some instances of impairment by way of\r\nillustration and establishes a rebuttable presumption of\r\nimpairment whenever a principal bypasses a dealer by distributing\r\nmerchandise directly; appoints additional dealers in contravention\r\nof the agreement; fails to adequately fill orders; or arbitrarily\r\nchanges the transportation and/or payment terms.   278a-1(b)(1)-\r\n(4).\r\nThe protection afforded dealers by Law 75, however, is\r\ncircumscribed by those rights acquired under the agreement\r\nregulating their business relationship.  Therefore, whether or not\r\nan impairment has taken place will depend upon the specific terms\r\nof the distribution contract.\r\n    The question whether there has been a\r\n\"detriment\" to the existing relationship\r\nbetween supplier and dealer is just another\r\nway of asking whether the terms of the\r\ncontract existing between the parties have\r\nbeen impaired.\r\n\nVulcan Tools of P.R. v. Makita USA, Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 569 (1st\r\nCir. 1994).\r\nThe parties do not dispute the fact that, pursuant to the\r\nagreement dated September 2, 1993, IRG had the exclusive\r\ndistribution rights of Murad products in Puerto Rico during a trial\r\nperiod lasting from August 25, 1993 through December 31, 1994. \r\nFurther, the document provided that should IRG meet a particular\r\nsales quota it would qualify to act as Murad's exclusive\r\ndistributor for an additional two years.\r\nIt is also uncontested that through its infomercial,\r\nwhich commenced airing in Puerto Rico in May 1994, Murad sold its\r\nproducts directly to local clientele.  The uncontroverted evidence\r\nat trial also established that Murad never intended the broadcast\r\nto be aired in Puerto Rico.  This was a fortuitous event brought\r\nabout by cable carriers not related to Murad in any way.\r\nMurad argues that it is not liable for impairment of the\r\nrelationship because once notified by plaintiffs-appellees of the\r\nbroadcast in Puerto Rico it promptly gave instructions for this\r\nsales mode to be discontinued.\r\nA principal may not be held accountable for unknown\r\nmarket interference by third parties.  However, once put on notice\r\nthat its products are reaching an area of limited distribution\r\nrights a principal has the obligation to take prompt positive\r\naction to curtail the practice.  Even though its role was not to\r\n\"stand as a vigilant dog\", Gen. Office Prod. Corp. v. Gussco Mfg.,\r\nInc., 666 F. Supp. 328, 333 (D.P.R. 1987), once informed of the\r\nlocal transmission Murad did have an affirmative duty to ensure\r\nthat the direct sales would cease and avoid further interference\r\nwith the Puerto Rico market.\r\nMurad argues that it was alerted to the local\r\ntransmission of the broadcast \"for the first time\" via a letter\r\ndated October 14, 1994 forwarded by Catherine Irvine (Appellant's\r\nbrief at 6) and that it immediately responded by taking steps to\r\navoid its recurrence.  However, there is enough information in the\r\nrecord from which a reasonable jury could infer that Murad was\r\nadvised of the broadcast much earlier than October 14, 1994.\r\nAt trial Dr. Murad acknowledged having been informed of\r\nthe broadcast matter \"a few weeks before\" receiving the October 14,\r\n1994 letter.  Further, this correspondence makes reference to a\r\nrequest made by IRG \"[a]bout a month ago\" for a list of local\r\ncustomers who had placed orders through the infomercial which\r\npresupposes Murad had been notified of this practice long before\r\nthe letter was mailed.  The letter also points to an earlier\r\ntelephone call by Gerard Sarnataro, Catherine Irvine's husband, on\r\nbehalf of IRG \"several days ago\" notifying of direct orders placed\r\nby him and others.  Lastly, the letter was a follow-up to a prior\r\nconversation between Catherine Irvine and Dr. Murad demanding some\r\nkind of response from Murad which again proves earlier contacts\r\nregarding the prohibited availability of Murad products through the\r\ninfomercial.\r\nIrvine also testified that she, her daughter and son-in-\r\nlaw \"started feeling the negative effects\" of the infomercial in\r\nthe summer of 1994.  She related how  customers and beauty salon\r\nowners complained to her that the products were being made\r\navailable through the television at lower prices.  Irvine further\r\nindicated that she, her daughter and her son-in-law \"immediately\r\ngot in touch with Mr. Angelo Fiorita,\" Murad's representative, to\r\nexpress their concern (emphasis ours) and that Mr. Fiorita\r\nresponded that he would \"speak with Dr. Murad and . . . take the\r\nnecessary steps for this to stop happening.\".  However, according\r\nto Irvine's testimony, \"[n]othing happened.\"  Irvine explained that\r\nthe October 1994 letter was eventually sent to Murad because the\r\nsituation continued to worsen without any corrective measures being\r\ntaken by Murad.\r\nGerard Sarnataro testified that he placed orders from\r\nPuerto Rico \"several times to test out\" how long Murad would\r\ncontinue the practice of selling the products directly in the local\r\nmarket.  Mr. Sarnataro further indicated that he continued\r\npurchasing products from Puerto Rico and calling Murad to object to\r\nwhat he considered an unauthorized practice.  At trial\r\nMr. Sarnataro also described how, despite his complaints,\r\napproximately two months later he had been approached over the\r\ntelephone to inquire if he was interested in reordering Murad's\r\nproducts.\r\nMurad's first remedial action was taken on October 25,\r\n1994.  Because the jury could logically infer that Murad was put\r\non notice of the interference soon after May 1994 Murad's argument\r\nthat it responded diligently is undermined by the evidence in the\r\nrecord.  Therefore, a reasonable fact finder could have found that\r\nthe exclusive distribution provision of the contract had been\r\nimpaired by Murad's failure to take prompt positive action in\r\nreacting to IRG's complaints.  However, our analysis under Law 75\r\ndoes not conclude here.\r\n                           Damages\r\nLaw 75 establishes a formula for the indemnification of\r\ndealers/distributors in the event of either termination or\r\nimpairment to the relationship by a principal without just cause. \r\nHowever, Law 75 specifically limits payment \"to the extent of the\r\ndamages caused [the dealer/distributor]\"  278b (emphasis ours). \r\nIt is clear from reading this provision that damages will not be\r\nautomatically conferred in all cases of termination and/or\r\nimpairment.  In this regard the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\r\nspecifically held in Marina Indus. Inc. v. Brown Boveri Corp., 114\r\nD.P.R. 64, 90 (1983) that the factors enumerated in  278b are not\r\nmandatory.  Rather, they constitute guidelines to be utilized\r\ncontingent upon the presentation of adequate proof in each case. \r\nFurther, in Marina Industrial the Supreme Court acknowledged that\r\nevidence of damages is an essential element of a Law 75 violation\r\nas to which plaintiff bears the burden of proof.  Therefore, in\r\norder to prevail, a Law 75 plaintiff must submit evidence of\r\ndamages as part of its action.\r\n    A claim for impermissible termination\r\nor impairment of a dealership contract under\r\nsection 278 has two essential elements; that\r\nthe contract existing between the parties was\r\nimpaired or terminated without just cause and\r\nthat there were resulting damages.  After the\r\nplaintiff has shown an impairment or\r\ntermination of the contract, the defendant may\r\noffer the affirmative defense of just cause. \r\nIf there was no just cause, the plaintiff must\r\nshow damages.\r\n\nDraft-Line Corp. v. Hon Co., 781 F. Supp. 841, 843 (D.P.R. 1991)\r\naff'd, 983 F.2d 1046 (1st Cir. 1993) (unpublished table decision).\r\nThe jury awarded IRG $390,000 as damages under Law 75.\r\nMurad argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the award\r\nwas based on the testimony of IRG's expert witness who relied on\r\nunsubstantiated facts for rendering his opinion.\r\nThe opinion rendered by plaintiffs' expert to justify\r\nIRG's damages was based on a formula using the ratio between the\r\nnumber of clinics opened by IRG and the corresponding volume of\r\nsales.  The expert then proceeded to make a projection of the\r\nanticipated sales of IRG had it opened 25 clinics within a term of\r\nfive years as originally planned.\r\nMurad argues the district court should have stricken the\r\ntestimony of the accountant regarding IRG's economic losses as\r\nunreliable under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509\r\nU.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), because the\r\nexpert's opinion was purportedly based on erroneous factual\r\ninformation.  In Kumho Tire Co. Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137,\r\n119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) the Supreme Court explained\r\nthat the presiding judge's role as \"gatekeeper\" in ensuring the\r\nreliability and relevancy of expert testimony as discussed in\r\nDaubert extends to opinions in both scientific and non-scientific\r\nfields.  However, the trial court has ample discretion in devising\r\nthe appropriate criteria for its determination on a case by case\r\nbasis.  \"[W]hether Daubert's specific factors are, or are not,\r\nreasonable measures of reliability in a particular case is a matter\r\nthat the law grants the trial judge broad latitude to determine.\" \r\nKumho Tire 119 S. Ct. at 1175.  Further, this \"same kind of\r\nlatitude\" will be afforded to the judge in selecting the procedure\r\nto be utilized for the inquiry.  Id.  A trial court's decision to\r\nexclude or admit expert testimony will be only be reversed for\r\nabuse of discretion.  Id. at 1171.\r\nOn appeal Murad points to alleged inaccuracies in the\r\nunderlying facts utilized by the expert in reaching his\r\nconclusions, which according to defendant-appellant render his\r\nassessment of IRG's damages unreliable.  In particular, Murad\r\nclaims that the accountant utilized incorrect sales data in\r\ndetermining the losses attributed to the alleged impairment. \r\nAccording to the expert, IRG's net income from Murad sales and\r\nservices for the fiscal year ending in July 1994 amounted to\r\n$71,468.\r\nThe accountant testified that \"the net income from the\r\nsales and services related to the Murad product, which was the\r\nwhole operation of IRG, were $71,468 [for fiscal year 1994].\" \r\nThese computations were based on the assumption that Murad products\r\nrepresented 100% of IRG sales of products and services throughout\r\nthe entire year.  The expert indicated that the percentage utilized\r\nby him in rendering his opinion was based exclusively on the\r\nrepresentations made by IRG management.  He did not examine any\r\ndocuments pertaining to IRG's purchases or sales to verify the\r\naccuracy of this information.\r\nHowever, during the first two months utilized by the\r\naccountant in determining IRG's net income Murad products\r\nrepresented only a small fraction of its sales.  This is confirmed\r\nin a letter dated August 23, 1993 wherein IRG indicated to Murad\r\nthat gross sales of Murad products \"has been at under 20%\" and\r\nprojected an increase to \"40% of the gross product sales being\r\nMurad products.\"\r\nIRG has attempted to down play the relevance of this\r\ninformation arguing that the August 23, 1993 correspondence\r\nanteceded the distribution agreement dated September 2, 1993 and\r\nthe introduction of Murad's Spa Line.  However, there is no\r\nevidence in the record establishing the specific percentage of the\r\nnet income derived from Murad products and/or services subsequent\r\nto the distribution agreement.  The only information in the record\r\nis that the Spa Line was introduced \"[i]n early 1994\" without\r\nregard to a particular sales volume and the testimony of Catherine\r\nIrvine Sarnataro acknowledging that non-Murad products had been\r\nsold by IRG during fiscal year 1993-94.\r\nAccording to Mr. Alvarez-Menndez, IRG's expert witness,\r\n\"[i]f they [IRG] sold other products besides the Murad product,\r\ndefinitely the calculations will have to change.\"  Thus, his\r\nconclusion regarding IRG's net income for the year preceding the\r\ninfomercial was contingent on Murad products representing 100% of\r\nIRG's business.\r\nBased on the information in the record it is impossible\r\nto determine what percentage of the IRG income was attributed to\r\nMurad products for this period much less conclude that it\r\nrepresented 100% as claimed by IRG.  Therefore, the basic premise\r\nof the expert's opinion to justify damages under Law 75 is flawed. \r\nAbsent adequate factual data to support the expert's conclusions\r\nhis testimony was unreliable.  Further, it appearing that in\r\nawarding damages to IRG the jury accepted the expert's unreliable \r\ncomputations, a new trial regarding IRG damages under Law 75 is\r\nwarranted.\r\n                       INDIVIDUAL CLAIM\r\nThe jury awarded Ileana Irvine $100,000 as damages for\r\nher pain and suffering and loss of reputation due to Murad's\r\nnegligent actions regarding the infomercial.\r\nMurad contends that Irvine has no personal cause of\r\naction and that there was no evidence of a causal relationship\r\nbetween its \"purchase of air time for the infomercial at a New York\r\ntelevision station\" and Irvine's purported damages (Appellants'\r\nBrief at 28).\r\nIn this jurisdiction tort liability is governed by art.\r\n1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  5141\r\n(1990) which imposes responsibility for damages caused by\r\nnegligence or fault.  The necessary elements to prevail in a tort\r\naction are: (1) a negligent act or omission, (2) damages and (3) a\r\ncausal relationship between them.  De-Jess-Adorno v. Browning\r\nFerris Indus. of P.R., Inc., 160 F.3d 839, 842 (1st Cir. 1998);\r\nMarshall v. Prez-Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir. 1987);\r\nMontalvo-Feliciano v.

E.L.A., 142 D.P.R.     , 97 JTS\r\n18 at 627 (1997).\r\nNot all actions or omissions which result in\r\ninjuries/damages will give rise to liability under art. 1802. \r\n\"Negligence has been defined by the Commonwealth courts as the\r\nfailure to exercise due diligence to avoid foreseeable risks.\" \r\nMalav-Flix, 946 F.2d at 971.  Therefore, liability will only\r\narise if the damages complained of were reasonably foreseeable to\r\nthe defendant.

The duty of care imposed upon a tortfeasor is\r\nanticipating reasonably probable injuries to probable victims. \r\nMarshall v. Prez-Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 847.  See Herminio M. Brau, Los\r\nDaos y Perjuicios Extracontractuales en Puerto Rico  7.02[2] at\r\n184-5 (2d ed. 1986).  The foreseeability contemplated by the\r\nstatute does not include every conceivable consequence of an act or\r\nomission since to do so would make the defendant an absolute\r\ninsurer.  See Montalvo-Feliciano, 144 D.P.R.     , 98 JTS at 499;\r\nPacheco v. A.F.F., 112 D.P.R. 296, 300 (1982); Jimnez v.\r\nPelegrina-Espinet, 112 D.P.R. 700, 704 (1982).\r\nFor purposes of our analysis we will assume that the\r\nconduct complained of by Irvine in support of her negligence claim\r\nis the same utilized by IRG for its Law 75 action, i.e., allowing\r\nthe Murad products to be sold directly in Puerto Rico.\r\nInasmuch as our review of the claim is limited by the\r\nconstraints of a Rule 50 motion, the issue then becomes whether\r\nthere is sufficiently reliable evidence in the record for a jury to\r\nconclude that the mental anguish and loss of reputation averred by\r\nIrvine were reasonably to be foreseen to Murad as a probable\r\nconsequence of the infomercial.  In other words whether, based on\r\nthe facts presented at trial as well as the permissible inferences\r\nderived therefrom, it was reasonable for the trier of fact to find\r\nthat Murad should have anticipated the resulting damages to Irvine\r\nindividually.  As previously mentioned, there is no actionable\r\nclaim under art. 1802 if the particular injury/damage complained of\r\nby Irvine could not have been reasonably foreseen by Murad.\r\nEven though Irvine described in detail the alleged\r\ninjuries to her reputation, humiliation and pain and suffering\r\ncaused by Murad's airing of the infomercial in Puerto Rico,\r\nliability based on art. 1802 cannot rest on the existence of an\r\ninjury alone.  Irvine did not introduce any evidence to explain\r\nwhy it should have been reasonably foreseeable to Murad that \r\nmaking its products available in Puerto Rico at lower prices would\r\nsomehow affect her personally.  At trial when asked by her counsel\r\nto describe her relationship with Murad, separate from that of IRG,\r\nIrvine merely responded that it was \"cordial\" and that she found\r\nDr. Murad \"very pleasant.\"  Her testimony in this regard was\r\ncircumscribed by the tenor of her and her daughter's contacts with\r\nthe Murad representatives.  No mention was made of any particular\r\ncircumstances in her dealings with Murad which would support her\r\nindividual claim.\r\nAdditionally, the documentary evidence submitted at trial\r\nfurther supports Murad's theory.  The distribution agreement was\r\nmade with the corporation, not Irvine.  All the correspondence\r\navailable in the record which was exchanged between Murad and\r\nplaintiffs/appellants was conducted through the corporation.\r\nAccordingly, Irvine did not produce any evidence at trial\r\nfrom which the jury could reasonably conclude that her personal\r\ndamages were a probable and foreseeable consequence of Murad's\r\ninfomercial.  Irvine's individual claim must be DISMISSED for\r\nhaving failed to meet her burden of proof.                            CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the judgment in IRG's favor is vacated and\r\nLaw 75 claim is remanded for a new trial.  Further, we direct the\r\ndistrict court to set aside the judgment regarding Irvine's\r\nindividual claim and enter judgment as a matter of law in the\r\nappellant's favor on this claim.  All parties shall bear their own\r\ncosts.\n",

Irvine and her daughter, Catherine Irvine Sarnataro,           both \"aestheticians,\" i.e. skin care specialists, first came in contact with the Murad line of products at a trade           show in Chicago in 1989. Irvine testified at trial that there was a \"glycolic acid revolution\" in the industry at the           time and she found the glycolic acid manufactured by Murad to be the \"most effective\" of all the other products           available in the market. Initially, she purchased Murad products for her own clients but since 1991 she also sold           them to various salons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Irvine and her daughter met periodically with Dr. Howard Murad, president of Murad, at various           conferences and conveyed to him an interest in becoming the exclusive distributor of Murad products in Puerto           Rico. The conversations culminated in a provisional exclusive distribution agreement dated September 2, 1993           with IRG, a corporation established and controlled by Irvine and her daughter. The contract would be extended           after December 1994 conditioned upon IRG meeting certain sales quotas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Irvine and her daughter testified regarding their efforts on behalf of IRG to develop a market for the Murad           skin products in Puerto Rico which included promotions, advertisements, demonstrations, training and education           of both aestheticians and dermatologists. IRG operated through its own clinics and also sold to aestheticians and           medical offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1994 Murad broadcast an infomercial on various stateside cable television stations as part of its           advertising campaign. Dr. Murad testified that the purpose behind the infomercial was to expose their home           products to customers and also to lure them into the salons for professional treatment. Unbeknown to Murad, a           New York station relayed the infomercial to Puerto Rico and its products were thereby made available locally           through telemarketing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to plaintiffs-appellees, the infomercial marked the beginning of the economic downfall of both IRG           and Irvine. After IRG learned of the telemarketing incursion, it sought relief under the Puerto Rico Distributorship           Act, Law 75 of June 24, 1964, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10 &#167; 278 et seq. (1997) whereas Irvine sued under the local           torts statute. The jury found for plaintiffs-appellees and awarded $390,000 to IRG and $100,000 to Irvine as           damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">RULE 50</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitions for judgments as a matter of law under Rule 50(a)(1) Fed.

The statute was initially enacted to avoid the inequity of arbitrary           termination of distribution relationships once the designated dealer had successfully developed a local market for           the principal's products and/or services. Sheils Title Co., 184 F.3d at 14; Euromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am.,           Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 870 (1st Cir. 1998); Borschow Hosp. and Med. Supplies, Inc. v.

In order           to accomplish its goal Law 75 limited the principal's ability to end the relationship unilaterally except for \"just           cause,\" &#167; 278a, while subjecting the principal to considerable economic liability for unjustifiable terminations.

However, there is enough information in the record from which a reasonable           jury could infer that Murad was advised of the broadcast much earlier than October 14, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Dr. Murad acknowledged having been informed of the broadcast matter \"a few weeks before\" receiving           the October 14, 1994 letter. Further, this correspondence makes reference to a request made by IRG \"[a]bout a           month ago\" for a list of local customers who had placed orders through the infomercial which presupposes           Murad had been notified of this practice long before the letter was mailed. The letter also points to an earlier           telephone call by Gerard Sarnataro, Catherine Irvine's husband, on behalf of IRG \"several days ago\" notifying of           direct orders placed by him and others. Lastly, the letter was a follow-up to a prior conversation between           Catherine Irvine and Dr. Murad demanding some kind of response from Murad which again proves earlier           contacts regarding the prohibited availability of Murad products through the infomercial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irvine also testified that she, her daughter and son-in- law \"started feeling the negative effects\" of the infomercial           in the summer of 1994. She related how customers and beauty salon owners complained to her that the products           were being made available through the television at lower prices. Irvine further indicated that she, her daughter           and her son-in-law \"immediately got in touch with Mr. Angelo Fiorita,\" Murad's representative, to express their           concern (emphasis ours) and that Mr. Fiorita responded that he would \"speak with Dr. Murad and . . . take the           necessary steps for this to stop happening.\". However, according to Irvine's testimony, \"[n]othing happened.\"           Irvine explained that the October 1994 letter was eventually sent to Murad because the situation continued to           worsen without any corrective measures being taken by Murad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gerard Sarnataro testified that he placed orders from Puerto Rico \"several times to test out\" how long Murad           would continue the practice of selling the products directly in the local market. Mr. Sarnataro further indicated           that he continued purchasing products from Puerto Rico and calling Murad to object to what he considered an           unauthorized practice. At trial Mr. Sarnataro also described how, despite his complaints, approximately two           months later he had been approached over the telephone to inquire if he was interested in reordering Murad's           products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murad's first remedial action was taken on October 25, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Because the jury could logically infer that           Murad was put on notice of the interference soon after May 1994 Murad's argument that it responded diligently           is undermined by the evidence in the record. Therefore, a reasonable fact finder could have found that the           exclusive distribution provision of the contract had been impaired by Murad's failure to take prompt positive           action in reacting to IRG's complaints.

However, Law 75 specifically limits payment \"to           the extent of the damages caused [the dealer/distributor]\" &#167; 278b (emphasis ours). It is clear from reading this           provision that damages will not be automatically conferred in all cases of termination and/or impairment. In this           regard the Puerto Rico Supreme Court specifically held in Marina Indus. Inc. v. Brown Boveri Corp., 114           D.P.R. 64, 90 (1983) that the factors enumerated in &#167; 278b are not mandatory. Rather, they constitute           guidelines to be utilized contingent upon the presentation of adequate proof in each case. Further, in Marina           Industrial the Supreme Court acknowledged that evidence of damages is an essential element of a Law 75           violation as to which plaintiff bears the burden of proof.

In           particular, Murad claims that the accountant utilized incorrect sales data in determining the losses attributed to the           alleged impairment. According to the expert, IRG's net income from Murad sales and services for the fiscal year           ending in July 1994 amounted to $71,468.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The accountant testified that \"the net income from the sales and services related to the Murad product, which           was the whole operation of IRG, were $71,468 [for fiscal year 1994].\" These computations were based on the           assumption that Murad products represented 100% of IRG sales of products and services throughout the entire year. The expert indicated that the percentage utilized by him in rendering his opinion was based exclusively on           the representations made by IRG management. He did not examine any documents pertaining to IRG's purchases           or sales to verify the accuracy of this information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, during the first two months utilized by the accountant in determining IRG's net income Murad products           represented only a small fraction of its sales. This is confirmed in a letter dated August 23, 1993 wherein IRG           indicated to Murad that gross sales of Murad products \"has been at under 20%\" and projected an increase to           \"40% of the gross product sales being Murad products.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IRG has attempted to down play the relevance of this information arguing that the August 23, 1993           correspondence anteceded the distribution agreement dated September 2, 1993 and the introduction of Murad's           Spa Line. However, there is no evidence in the record establishing the specific percentage of the net income           derived from Murad products and/or services subsequent to the distribution agreement. The only information in           the record is that the Spa Line was introduced \"[i]n early 1994\" without regard to a particular sales volume and           the testimony of Catherine Irvine Sarnataro acknowledging that non-Murad products had been sold by IRG           during fiscal year 1993-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Mr. Alvarez-Menendez, IRG's expert witness, \"[i]f they [IRG] sold other products besides the           Murad product, definitely the calculations will have to change.\" Thus, his Conclusion regarding IRG's net income           for the year preceding the infomercial was contingent on Murad products representing 100% of IRG's business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the information in the record it is impossible to determine what percentage of the IRG income was           attributed to Murad products for this period much less conclude that it represented 100% as claimed by IRG.           Therefore, the basic premise of the expert's opinion to justify damages under Law 75 is flawed. Absent adequate           factual data to support the expert's Conclusions his testimony was unreliable. Further, it appearing that in           awarding damages to IRG the jury accepted the expert's unreliable computations, a new trial regarding IRG           damages under Law 75 is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>INDIVIDUAL CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded Ileana Irvine $100,000 as damages for her pain and suffering and loss of reputation due to           Murad's negligent actions regarding the infomercial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murad contends that Irvine has no personal cause of action and that there was no evidence of a causal           relationship between its \"purchase of air time for the infomercial at a New York television station\" and Irvine's           purported damages (Appellants' Brief at 28).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this jurisdiction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  tort liability is governed by art. 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R.

In other words whether, based on the facts presented at trial as well as the permissible inferences           derived therefrom, it was reasonable for the trier of fact to find that Murad should have anticipated the resulting           damages to Irvine individually. As previously mentioned, there is no actionable claim under art. 1802 if the           particular injury/damage complained of by Irvine could not have been reasonably foreseen by Murad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Irvine described in detail the alleged injuries to her reputation, humiliation and pain and suffering           caused by Murad's airing of the infomercial in Puerto Rico, liability based on art. 1802 cannot rest on the           existence of an injury alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Irvine did not introduce any evidence to explain why it should have been           reasonably foreseeable to Murad that making its products available in Puerto Rico at lower prices would           somehow affect her personally. At trial when asked by her counsel to describe her relationship with Murad,           separate from that of IRG, Irvine merely responded that it was \"cordial\" and that she found Dr. Murad \"very           pleasant.\" Her testimony in this regard was circumscribed by the tenor of her and her daughter's contacts with the           Murad representatives. No mention was made of any particular circumstances in her dealings with Murad which           would support her individual claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the documentary evidence submitted at trial further supports Murad's theory.

(\"Murad\") challenges the verdict           rendered in favor of both plaintiffs IRG RESEARCH GROUP, INC. (\"IRG\") and Ileana Irvine (\"Irvine\").           Specifically, Murad alleges that the district court erred by (1) not granting its motion for judgment as a matter of           law; (2) declining to charge the jury in accordance with its proffered instruction on foreseeability; (3) denying its           petition for a new trial; and (4) allowing the testimony of plaintiffs' expert witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review we agree with Murad's reasoning that it is entitled to a new trial vis-...-vis IRG, and that Irvine's           individual claim should have been dismissed as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murad is a stateside manufacturer of skin care products. Irvine and her daughter, Catherine Irvine Sarnataro,           both \"aestheticians,\" i.e. skin care specialists, first came in contact with the Murad line of products at a trade           show in Chicago in 1989. Irvine testified at trial that there was a \"glycolic acid revolution\" in the industry at the           time and she found the glycolic acid manufactured by Murad to be the \"most effective\" of all the other products           available in the market. Initially, she purchased Murad products for her own clients but since 1991 she also sold           them to various salons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Irvine and her daughter met periodically with Dr. Howard Murad, president of Murad, at various           conferences and conveyed to him an interest in becoming the exclusive distributor of Murad products in Puerto           Rico. The conversations culminated in a provisional exclusive distribution agreement dated September 2, 1993           with IRG, a corporation established and controlled by Irvine and her daughter. The contract would be extended           after December 1994 conditioned upon IRG meeting certain sales quotas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Irvine and her daughter testified regarding their efforts on behalf of IRG to develop a market for the Murad           skin products in Puerto Rico which included promotions, advertisements, demonstrations, training and education           of both aestheticians and dermatologists. IRG operated through its own clinics and also sold to aestheticians and           medical offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1994 Murad broadcast an infomercial on various stateside cable television stations as part of its           advertising campaign. Dr. Murad testified that the purpose behind the infomercial was to expose their home           products to customers and also to lure them into the salons for professional treatment. Unbeknown to Murad, a           New York station relayed the infomercial to Puerto Rico and its products were thereby made available locally           through telemarketing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to plaintiffs-appellees, the infomercial marked the beginning of the economic downfall of both IRG           and Irvine. After IRG learned of the telemarketing incursion, it sought relief under the Puerto Rico Distributorship           Act, Law 75 of June 24, 1964, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10 &#167; 278 et seq. (1997) whereas Irvine sued under the local           torts statute. The jury found for plaintiffs-appellees and awarded $390,000 to IRG and $100,000 to Irvine as           damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">RULE 50</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitions for judgments as a matter of law under Rule 50(a)(1) Fed.

However, there is enough information in the record from which a reasonable           jury could infer that Murad was advised of the broadcast much earlier than October 14, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Dr. Murad acknowledged having been informed of the broadcast matter \"a few weeks before\" receiving           the October 14, 1994 letter. Further, this correspondence makes reference to a request made by IRG \"[a]bout a           month ago\" for a list of local customers who had placed orders through the infomercial which presupposes           Murad had been notified of this practice long before the letter was mailed. The letter also points to an earlier           telephone call by Gerard Sarnataro, Catherine Irvine's husband, on behalf of IRG \"several days ago\" notifying of           direct orders placed by him and others. Lastly, the letter was a follow-up to a prior conversation between           Catherine Irvine and Dr. Murad demanding some kind of response from Murad which again proves earlier           contacts regarding the prohibited availability of Murad products through the infomercial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irvine also testified that she, her daughter and son-in- law \"started feeling the negative effects\" of the infomercial           in the summer of 1994. She related how customers and beauty salon owners complained to her that the products           were being made available through the television at lower prices. Irvine further indicated that she, her daughter           and her son-in-law \"immediately got in touch with Mr. Angelo Fiorita,\" Murad's representative, to express their           concern (emphasis ours) and that Mr. Fiorita responded that he would \"speak with Dr. Murad and . . . take the           necessary steps for this to stop happening.\". However, according to Irvine's testimony, \"[n]othing happened.\"           Irvine explained that the October 1994 letter was eventually sent to Murad because the situation continued to           worsen without any corrective measures being taken by Murad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gerard Sarnataro testified that he placed orders from Puerto Rico \"several times to test out\" how long Murad           would continue the practice of selling the products directly in the local market. Mr. Sarnataro further indicated           that he continued purchasing products from Puerto Rico and calling Murad to object to what he considered an           unauthorized practice. At trial Mr. Sarnataro also described how, despite his complaints, approximately two           months later he had been approached over the telephone to inquire if he was interested in reordering Murad's           products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murad's first remedial action was taken on October 25, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Because the jury could logically infer that           Murad was put on notice of the interference soon after May 1994 Murad's argument that it responded diligently           is undermined by the evidence in the record. Therefore, a reasonable fact finder could have found that the           exclusive distribution provision of the contract had been impaired by Murad's failure to take prompt positive           action in reacting to IRG's complaints.

However, Law 75 specifically limits payment \"to           the extent of the damages caused [the dealer/distributor]\" &#167; 278b (emphasis ours). It is clear from reading this           provision that damages will not be automatically conferred in all cases of termination and/or impairment. In this           regard the Puerto Rico Supreme Court specifically held in Marina Indus. Inc. v. Brown Boveri Corp., 114           D.P.R. 64, 90 (1983) that the factors enumerated in &#167; 278b are not mandatory. Rather, they constitute           guidelines to be utilized contingent upon the presentation of adequate proof in each case. Further, in Marina           Industrial the Supreme Court acknowledged that evidence of damages is an essential element of a Law 75           violation as to which plaintiff bears the burden of proof. Therefore, in order to prevail, a Law 75 plaintiff must           submit evidence of damages as part of its action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claim for impermissible termination or impairment of a dealership contract under section 278 has two essential           elements; that the contract existing between the parties was impaired or terminated without just cause and that           there were resulting damages. After the plaintiff has shown an impairment or termination of the contract, the           defendant may offer the affirmative defense of just cause.

In           particular, Murad claims that the accountant utilized incorrect sales data in determining the losses attributed to the           alleged impairment. According to the expert, IRG's net income from Murad sales and services for the fiscal year           ending in July 1994 amounted to $71,468.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The accountant testified that \"the net income from the sales and services related to the Murad product, which           was the whole operation of IRG, were $71,468 [for fiscal year 1994].\" These computations were based on the           assumption that Murad products represented 100% of IRG sales of products and services throughout the entire year. The expert indicated that the percentage utilized by him in rendering his opinion was based exclusively on           the representations made by IRG management. He did not examine any documents pertaining to IRG's purchases           or sales to verify the accuracy of this information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, during the first two months utilized by the accountant in determining IRG's net income Murad products           represented only a small fraction of its sales. This is confirmed in a letter dated August 23, 1993 wherein IRG           indicated to Murad that gross sales of Murad products \"has been at under 20%\" and projected an increase to           \"40% of the gross product sales being Murad products.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IRG has attempted to down play the relevance of this information arguing that the August 23, 1993           correspondence anteceded the distribution agreement dated September 2, 1993 and the introduction of Murad's           Spa Line. However, there is no evidence in the record establishing the specific percentage of the net income           derived from Murad products and/or services subsequent to the distribution agreement. The only information in           the record is that the Spa Line was introduced \"[i]n early 1994\" without regard to a particular sales volume and           the testimony of Catherine Irvine Sarnataro acknowledging that non-Murad products had been sold by IRG           during fiscal year 1993-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Mr. Alvarez-Menendez, IRG's expert witness, \"[i]f they [IRG] sold other products besides the           Murad product, definitely the calculations will have to change.\" Thus, his Conclusion regarding IRG's net income           for the year preceding the infomercial was contingent on Murad products representing 100% of IRG's business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the information in the record it is impossible to determine what percentage of the IRG income was           attributed to Murad products for this period much less conclude that it represented 100% as claimed by IRG.           Therefore, the basic premise of the expert's opinion to justify damages under Law 75 is flawed. Absent adequate           factual data to support the expert's Conclusions his testimony was unreliable. Further, it appearing that in           awarding damages to IRG the jury accepted the expert's unreliable computations, a new trial regarding IRG           damages under Law 75 is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>INDIVIDUAL CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded Ileana Irvine $100,000 as damages for her pain and suffering and loss of reputation due to           Murad's negligent actions regarding the infomercial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murad contends that Irvine has no personal cause of action and that there was no evidence of a causal           relationship between its \"purchase of air time for the infomercial at a New York television station\" and Irvine's           purported damages (Appellants' Brief at 28).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this jurisdiction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  tort liability is governed by art. 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R.

In other words whether, based on the facts presented at trial as well as the permissible inferences           derived therefrom, it was reasonable for the trier of fact to find that Murad should have anticipated the resulting           damages to Irvine individually.

At trial when asked by her counsel to describe her relationship with Murad,           separate from that of IRG, Irvine merely responded that it was \"cordial\" and that she found Dr. Murad \"very           pleasant.\" Her testimony in this regard was circumscribed by the tenor of her and her daughter's contacts with the           Murad representatives. No mention was made of any particular circumstances in her dealings with Murad which           would support her individual claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the documentary evidence submitted at trial further supports Murad's theory. The distribution           agreement was made with the corporation, not Irvine. All the correspondence available in the record which was           exchanged between Murad and plaintiffs/appellants was conducted through the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, Irvine did not produce any evidence at trial from which the jury could reasonably conclude that her           personal damages were a probable and foreseeable consequence of Murad's infomercial. Irvine's individual claim           must be DISMISSED for having failed to meet her burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment in IRG's favor is vacated and Law 75 claim is remanded for a new trial. Further, we           direct the district court to set aside the judgment regarding Irvine's individual claim and enter judgment as a           matter of law in the appellant's favor on this claim.
