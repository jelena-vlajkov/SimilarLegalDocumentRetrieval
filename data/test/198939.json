In this case, the plaintiffs sought to\n\nobtain various documents under the Freedom of Information Act\n\n(FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552.      The paperwork pertained to a February\n\n1997 indoor air quality study conducted with respect to an\n\nagency   workplace    in   Salem,    Massachusetts.

The\n\ndistrict court referred the motions to a magistrate judge, see\n\nFed. R. Civ.

This appeal ensued.\n\n          We previously have stated that when a judge accurately\n\ntakes the measure of a case and articulates his or her rationale\n\nclearly and convincingly, \"an appellate court should refrain\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\ffrom writing at length to no other end than to hear its own\n\nwords resonate.\"   Lawton v.

This tenet has particular value where, as here, no new\n\nlaw is broached, and the case on appeal involves, in the last\n\nanalysis, the application of settled legal principles to a\n\nspecific set of facts.

We add only that we\n\ntoo have reviewed the disputed documents, and that we believe\n\nthe magistrate's appraisal of them — especially his conclusion\n\nthat they are both predecisional and within the deliberative\n\nprocess — is fully consistent with our holding in Providence\n\nJournal Co. v.
