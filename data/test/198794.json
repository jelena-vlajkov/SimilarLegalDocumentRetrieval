Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Sharon Hughes Mendonca on brief pro se.\r\n   David W. Ogden, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Joan E.\r\nSmiley, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Anthony W. Norwood, Trial\r\nAttorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 30, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Petitioner Sharon Hughes Mendonca, on\r\nbehalf of her husband Crisanto Mendonca (a citizen of Cape\r\nVerde), appeals from the denial of a petition under 28 U.S.C.\r\n 2241 for habeas corpus relief.  Petitioner there sought to\r\nchallenge a discretionary decision of the Board of Immigration\r\nAppeals (BIA) denying her husband's application for adjustment\r\nof status, see 8 U.S.C.  1255; she also requested an order\r\ncompelling his naturalization.  The district court dismissed\r\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  See Mendonca v. INS,\r\n52 F. Supp. 2d 155 (D. Mass. 1999).  \r\n          With respect to the naturalization issue, we affirm\r\nsubstantially for the reasons recited by the district court. \r\nSee id. at 163-64.  With respect to the adjustment-of-status\r\nissue, we affirm on the merits.  Respondent is mistaken in\r\nasserting that  309(c)(4)(E) of IIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208,\r\nDiv. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546, divests the district court of\r\nhabeas jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Requena-Rodriguez v.\r\nPasquarell, 190 F.3d 299, 305 (5th Cir. 1999); Goncalves v.\r\nReno, 144 F.3d 110, 120-21 (1st Cir. 1998) (construing \r\n309(c)(4)(G)), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1140 (1999).  \r\n          In turn, whether federal courts in such \"transitional\r\nrules\" cases possess residual jurisdiction under  2241 to\r\nreview discretionary determinations of the BIA is a question\r\nnot subject to ready resolution.  See, e.g., id. at 125 n.17\r\n(noting, without addressing, argument from amici that \"habeas\r\njurisdiction also traditionally allowed review, under a\r\n'manifest abuse of discretion' standard, of the exercise of\r\ndiscretion to deny relief\").  However, the question how far\r\nhabeas jurisdiction extends is one of great practical\r\nimportance, and there is no reason to address it in this case. \r\nEven assuming that habeas jurisdiction does extend in this\r\nmatter to abuses of discretion--and this is very much an\r\narguendo assumption--there is nothing in this case that\r\nremotely suggests such an abuse by the BIA.  Accordingly,\r\nwhatever the scope of habeas corpus, there is no basis for\r\nsetting aside the BIA's refusal to adjust status.\r\n          Our affirmance on this ground does not offend Steel\r\nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83 (1998). \r\nWe think that the question whether  2241 encompasses such\r\nclaims, rather than being jurisdictional in nature, instead\r\ngoes to the merits.  \"[T]he absence of a valid (as opposed to\r\narguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter\r\njurisdiction, i.e., the courts' statutory or constitutional\r\npower to adjudicate the case.\"  Id. at 89 (characterizing as\r\nnon-jurisdictional the question whether a citizen-suit\r\nprovision of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know\r\nAct of 1986 permits suits for past violations); see also, e.g.,\r\nDavoll v. Webb, 194 F.3d 1116,     , 1999 WL 969263, at *5-*6\r\n(10th Cir. 1999); Cablevision of Boston, Inc. v. Public\r\nImprovement Comm'n, 184 F.3d 88, 100 &amp; n.9 (1st Cir. 1999).  \r\n          Affirmed.\n",
