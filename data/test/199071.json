Appellants challenge the\n\nconvictions and sentences imposed for their respective roles in\n\nan armed hostage-taking which took place in the District of\n\nPuerto Rico in 1997.    For the most part, but see infra Sections\n\nII.A.2.b & II.D, their appeals fail.\n\n                                  I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n          On August 17, 1997, appellant Peña-Morfe and a person\n\ncalled “Charlie” abducted Richardson Leo Mieses-Pimentel at\n\ngunpoint as he was leaving the Chris Café, a place of business\n\nowned by his family.      The abductors placed a hood over the\n\nvictim’s head, handcuffed him, and transported him to a private\n\nresidence, where he was interrogated regarding his family’s\n\nfinancial resources, then informed that his abductors intended\n\nto demand a $500,000 ransom from the family.        Throughout the\n\nensuing   ten-day   captivity,   Mieses-Pimentel   was   continually\n\nblindfolded, forcibly restrained (i.e., handcuffed in a bathtub\n\nor chained to a bed), and repeatedly threatened with death.\n\nFollowing three days of captivity at the initial site, during\n\nwhich the captors unsuccessfully phoned Mieses-Pimentel’s family\n\nto negotiate a ransom, another accomplice — Santiago Acosta-\n\nMolina — was recruited and Mieses-Pimentel was relocated at\n\nnighttime to the Acosta-Molina residence.\n\n\n                                  5\n\f            During the ensuing captivity, Acosta-Molina observed\n\nPeña-Morfe, Lorenzo-Pérez and Peña-Lora toting various weapons,\n\nincluding    revolvers,       while    placing    phone    calls   to   Mieses-\n\nPimentel’s family.          At one point, Lorenzo-Pérez threatened the\n\nnewly     recruited         accomplice,      Acosta-Molina,    with     an   UZI\n\nsubmachine gun, which he referred to as “The Silencer” used “for\n\nthe people who talk.”         Throughout this period of captivity, the\n\nthree defendants repeatedly assaulted Acosta-Molina with blows\n\nto the face and chest.\n\n            Three days later, at Acosta-Molina’s insistence, the\n\noriginal captors relocated Mieses-Pimentel to a residence in\n\nBarrio Obrero, informing him that he was being taken to the\n\nplace where he would be killed.                 Upon arrival at this third\n\nresidence,    Mieses-Pimentel         was    handcuffed,   blindfolded,      and\n\nchained to a bed in a rear bedroom.\n\n            At about the same time, an INS agent recognized Peña-\n\nMorfe’s voice from an FBI tape of a ransom call to the victim’s\n\nfamily.     After arranging a meeting with Peña-Morfe, the INS\n\nagent      placed     him   under     arrest.     Peña-Morfe   admitted      his\n\nparticipation in the abduction and led the FBI to the third\n\nresidence, where Mieses-Pimentel was being held hostage.\n\n            An FBI SWAT team surrounded the residence, demanding\n\nthat its occupants surrender.               At this point in time — having\n\n\n                                         6\n\fbeen relieved of the blindfold and handcuffs by his captors —\n\nMieses-Pimentel saw someone running toward the rear of the\n\nresidence carrying firearms (including a machinegun).         Then he\n\nwas escorted to a different room at the rear of the residence,\n\nwhere he remained in the custody of appellant Lorenzo-Hernández,\n\nRaimary Lavandier (who was carrying a baby), and a male youth\n\nwhose identity was not disclosed at trial.\n\n            Ultimately, Raimary Lavandier and the unidentified male\n\nyouth    abandoned   Mieses-Pimentel,   exited   the   residence,   and\n\nsubmitted to arrest by the FBI.       A subsequent search disclosed\n\ntwo revolvers and an UZI machinegun secreted in the backyard of\n\nthe residence.\n\n            The four appellants, as well as Acosta-Molina and\n\nLavandier, were indicted for conspiring to commit a hostage-\n\ntaking for ransom (Count 1), see 18 U.S.C. § 1203 (a), and for\n\naiding and abetting the hostage-taking (Count 2), see id. & § 2.1\n\n\n     1  The statute provides:\n\n            [W]hoever, whether inside or outside the\n            United   States,  seizes   or  detains   and\n            threatens to kill, to injure, or to continue\n            to detain another person in order to compel\n            a   third    person   or    a   governmental\n            organization to do or abstain from doing any\n            act as an explicit or implicit condition for\n            the release of the person detained, or\n            attempts or conspires to do so, shall be\n            punished by imprisonment for any term of\n            years or for life and, if the death of any\n\n                                  7\n\fPeña-Morfe and Lorenzo-Pérez jointly were charged with using or\n\ncarrying firearms during and in relation to a crime of violence\n\n(viz.,   the   hostage-taking)   (Count   3).    See   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n924(c)(1).2 Finally, Peña-Morfe, Lorenzo-Hernández, and Lorenzo-\n\nPérez were jointly charged, in Count 4, with using or carrying\n\nthree weapons:    two .357 revolvers and an Israeli semiautomatic\n\n9 mm UZI.      See id. § 924(c)(1) & (2).       Pursuant to a plea\n\n\n\n            person results, shall be punished by death\n            or life imprisonment.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1203(a).\n    2The statute provides, in pertinent part:\n\n            [A]ny person who, during and in relation to\n            any crime of violence or drug trafficking\n            crime (including a crime of violence or drug\n            trafficking crime that provides for an\n            enhanced punishment if committed by the use\n            of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device)\n            for which the person may be prosecuted in a\n            court of the United States, uses or carries\n            a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any\n            such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in\n            addition to the punishment provided for such\n            crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\n            . . . be sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n            of not less than 5 years . . . . If the\n            firearm possessed by a person convicted of a\n            violation of this subsection . . . is a\n            machinegun or a destructive device, or is\n            equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm\n            muffler, the person shall be sentenced to a\n            term of imprisonment of not less than 30\n            years.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c).\n\n                                 8\n\fagreement with the government, Acosta-Molina was required to\n\ntestify against appellants at trial.\n\n            A superseding indictment modified the firearm counts\n\nas follows:       Count 4 charged Peña-Lora with using or carrying a\n\nfirearm; Count 5 charged Lorenzo-Hernández and Lorenzo-Pérez\n\nwith using or carrying firearms, “specifically a fully-automatic\n\n9    millimeter    UZI,   serial    number    UP00514,    as    defined    in   18\n\nU.S.C., Section 921(a)(23) and 26 U.S.C., Section 845(b), a\n\nRuger .357 revolver, serial number 153191995, and a Smith &\n\nWesson .357 revolver, serial number 90922c-19\"; Count 6 charged\n\nRaimary Lavandier with failing to report and/or concealing a\n\nfederal crime.       See 18 U.S.C. § 4.\n\n            After Acosta-Molina and Mieses-Pimentel testified for\n\nthe government at trial, guilty verdicts were returned against\n\neach    defendant    on   every     count    charged     in    the   superseding\n\nindictment.       Following sentencing, Peña-Morfe, Lorenzo-Pérez,\n\nLorenzo-Hernández, and Peña-Lora filed timely notices of appeal\n\nfrom their respective convictions and sentences.\n\n                                       II\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Appellants     claim    the     government    failed     to   present\n\nsufficient evidence to establish either the hostage-taking or\n\n\n                                       9\n\ffirearms counts.       See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29; supra notes 1 & 2.\n\nWe must affirm the jury verdicts unless the evidence and all\n\nreasonable inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment’s case, would not enable a rational jury to find each\n\nelement of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, see\n\nUnited States v. Hughes, 211 F.3d 676, 681 (1st Cir. 2000), even\n\nthough the prosecution may not have “‘present[ed] evidence that\n\npreclude[d]    every     reasonable        hypothesis   inconsistent     with\n\nguilt.’”    Id. (citation omitted).\n\n       1. Peña-Morfe, Lorenzo-Pérez and Peña-Lora\n\n            Peña-Morfe, Lorenzo-Pérez and Peña-Lora acknowledge\n\nthat    cooperating    defendant    Acosta-Molina       presented    graphic\n\neyewitness testimony unambiguously identifying and implicating\n\neach of them in the hostage-taking.              Moreover, Acosta-Molina\n\nunambiguously linked each to the use or carrying of the various\n\nfirearms.     Accordingly, these three defendants are limited to\n\nthe familiar appellate refrain that their trial jury rationally\n\ncould not have credited the testimony given by Acosta-Molina\n\nsince he had every incentive to prevaricate in order to gain\n\nfavorable    treatment    from     the     government   because     he   is   a\n\nconfessed hostage-taker himself.\n\n            With rare exceptions, it is the jury — rather than an\n\nappellate court — which must assess witness credibility.                  See\n\n\n                                      10\n\fUnited States v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 1998), cert.\n\ndenied, 526 U.S. 1124 (1999).                     “‘[A] conviction based solely\n\nupon       the   uncorroborated          testimony      of    an    accomplice      can    be\n\nupheld, as long as the jury is properly instructed and the\n\ntestimony is not incredible as a matter of law.’”                          United States\n\nv. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir.) (citation omitted), cert.\n\ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 79 (1999).\n\n                 Additionally, Acosta-Molina was subjected to vigorous\n\ncross-examination and the government acknowledged in its closing\n\nargument that he was a confessed hostage-taker, thus emphasizing\n\nthat the jury must carefully weigh his credibility.                                 See id.\n\n(“[A]n       accomplice      is    qualified       to   testify       as     long   as    any\n\nagreements he has made with the government are presented to the\n\njury       and   the   judge      gave    complete      and    correct       instructions\n\ndetailing the special care the jury should take in assessing the\n\ntestimony.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).3\n\n                 Moreover,     the   government         also       adduced    independent\n\nevidence         corroborating       the     Acosta-Molina           testimony.           For\n\ninstance, an INS agent recognized Peña-Morfe’s voice from the\n\n\n\n       3\n     The district court correctly instructed the jury that\nAcosta-Molina was “providing evidence under a plea and\ncooperation agreement with the government . . . [and] [w]hile\nsome people in this position are entirely truthful when\ntestifying, you should consider the testimony of these persons\nwith particular caution.”\n\n                                             11\n\ftapes made of the ransom calls, which were played for the jury\n\nat trial.    See United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 324\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).    The agent also took           Peña-Morfe’s post-arrest\n\nconfession, after which Peña-Morfe led the FBI to the residence\n\nwhere Mieses-Pimentel was being held.                On another tape, an\n\nabductor was referred to as “Luis” — the first name of defendant\n\nPeña-Lora.       Similarly,   Mieses-Pimentel         testified   that   he\n\noverheard one of his captors become extremely upset when a\n\ncohort inadvertently referred to him as “Luis,” rather than by\n\nhis alias.\n\n            Accordingly, the sufficiency challenges relating to the\n\nhostage-taking     and   firearms        counts     against   these   three\n\nappellants fail.\n\n\n\n\n                                    12\n\f       2.        Lorenzo-Hernández\n\n                 The     sufficiency         challenges     asserted      by     Lorenzo-\n\nHernández are more problematic for the government.4                        Although he\n\nconcedes that the government established that he was in the\n\nhouse       on    the    morning       the    FBI   rescued   Mieses-Pimentel,          he\n\nmaintains         that    his    actions      proved     nothing   more     than   “mere\n\npresence”         at    the   scene     of    the   crime,    rather      than    knowing\n\nparticipation in the abduction.                     See, e.g., United States v.\n\nCruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d 986, 1001 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that\n\n“mere presence” at crime scene normally is insufficient to\n\nestablish         knowing       participation       in    offense).       Accordingly,\n\nLorenzo-Hernández contends that the jury rationally could not\n\nhave       inferred      from    the    available      evidence    that    he    had   the\n\nrequisite specific intent to commit either the hostage-taking or\n\nthe firearm offenses.              See id.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n     Although Acosta-Molina actually participated in the\nhostage-taking with the three other appellants, he did not\nimplicate Lorenzo-Hernández, whom he did not meet until after\nhis arrest.     In rejecting Lorenzo-Hernández’s motion for\njudgment of acquittal, the district court downplayed this fact,\nhowever, because Lorenzo-Hernández’s alleged role in the\nconspiracy did not commence until after Mieses-Pimentel had been\nrelocated from the Acosta-Molina residence. Nonetheless, it is\nsignificant that Acosta-Molina testified that he had visited the\nthird residence after Mieses-Pimentel was taken there. Acosta-\nMolina testified that he met Peña-Morfe and others there, but\nmade no mention of Lorenzo-Hernández.\n\n                                               13\n\f            A close review of the entire trial record discloses:\n\n(a)     ample      evidence        that     Lorenzo-Hernández       intended   to\n\nparticipate in the hostage-taking; and (b) insufficient evidence\n\nfor the firearm conviction under Count 5.\n\n            a.     The Evidence\n\n            The entire case against Lorenzo-Hernández rests on\n\nMieses-Pimentel’s eyewitness testimony concerning the events on\n\nthe final morning of his captivity, after the FBI had surrounded\n\nthe   third      residence    at    which       he   had   been   held   hostage.\n\nAccordingly,      we   scrutinize         the   trial   testimony   provided   by\n\nMieses-Pimentel.\n\n            Government counsel asked Mieses-Pimentel who had been\n\npresent during his three-day captivity at the third residence.\n\nMieses-Pimentel responded that he had heard the voices of a\n\nfemale, a baby, and “two male[s].”                   During that time, Mieses-\n\nPimentel was continuously blindfolded and chained to a bed in\n\nthe rear of the house.         These same “two male[s]” — though not\n\nthe female — had come into the bedroom on a regular basis\n\nthroughout his captivity, to bring food and escort him to the\n\nbathroom.\n\n            On the morning the FBI surrounded the house and called\n\nfor its occupants to surrender, one of these two males (we shall\n\nrefer to him as “Male A”) hurriedly entered the rear bedroom,\n\n\n                                           14\n\ftold Mieses-Pimentel to be silent, removed his blindfold and\n\nhandcuffs, then relocated him to another room at the rear of the\n\nhouse.\n\n           At trial, Mieses-Pimentel perfunctorily described Male\n\nA as “a younger guy with a dark complexion.”      Government counsel\n\nthen   asked   Mieses-Pimentel:    “What   else   did   [you]   see?”   —\n\npresumably, when Mieses-Pimentel reached the other room at the\n\nrear of the residence.      To which Mieses-Pimentel responded:\n\n“the other person, he was a young guy” (Male B?), the female,\n\nand the baby.      Government counsel then asked Mieses-Pimentel\n\nwhether he could identify “any of these people in the courtroom\n\ntoday.” Whereupon Mieses-Pimentel pointed out Raimary Lavandier\n\nand “the person sitting next to her,” whom government counsel\n\nidentified as Lorenzo-Hernández.\n\n           The ensuing testimony from Mieses-Pimentel exhibits a\n\nglaring inconsistency, however.        When asked what “the other\n\nindividual that you have identified sitting next to [Raimary\n\nLavandier]” — viz., in the courtroom, i.e., Lorenzo-Hernández —\n\nhad done once Mieses-Pimentel had been relieved of the blindfold\n\nand handcuffs, Mieses-Pimentel replied:       “He was the one that\n\ntook me to the back room and told me to sit down and to act like\n\nI was one of them.”\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\f         At first blush, the quoted testimony suggests that\n\nLorenzo-Hernández was Male A, identified earlier by Mieses-\n\nPimentel, see supra, as the only individual who had entered the\n\nrear bedroom after the FBI arrived.     However, when government\n\ncounsel asked Mieses-Pimentel whether the individual who had\n\nremoved the blindfold    was present in the courtroom, Mieses-\n\nPimentel responded:     “[n]o,” notwithstanding the fact that he\n\nhad testified earlier that a single individual — i.e., Male A —\n\nhad removed both his blindfold and the handcuffs, then escorted\n\nhim from the rear bedroom to a different room in the rear of the\n\nresidence.\n\n         Rather than resolving this testimonial discrepancy,\n\nhowever, government counsel asked Mieses-Pimentel to describe\n\nthe scene he encountered upon arriving in the other room at the\n\nrear of the residence.    Mieses-Pimentel responded that the four\n\npersons who were in the room with him were “real nervous,” and\n\nthe “girl” (viz., Lavandier) started to cry.    “The other person\n\nthat is not here today . . . got up and ran outside the room,”\n\nfollowed shortly thereafter by the woman carrying the baby.\n\n(Emphasis added.)   “The other person who was sitting next to her\n\n[viz., in the rear room, i.e., Lorenzo-Hernández] . . . ask[ed]\n\n[Mieses-Pimentel] not to move around too much in case the FBI\n\ncame inside they would think he was looking for a gun and shoot\n\n\n                                16\n\fus right there.”     Lorenzo-Hernández then “got up and ran outside\n\nand . . . left [Mieses-Pimentel] sitting there by [himself].”\n\n          When government counsel asked whether Mieses-Pimentel\n\nhad seen any weapons “[a]fter the blindfold was removed[,]” he\n\nanswered: “Yes, before they took me in the room [i.e., the rear\n\nroom to which he was relocated] I saw the other person.           He was\n\nrunning towards the back of the house and carrying some weapons\n\nin his hands.”      (Emphasis added.)     Mieses-Pimentel identified\n\nthese weapons as “a small machine gun” and the two firearms used\n\nto abduct him from the Chris Café.\n\n          With respect to the sufficiency challenges to the\n\nLorenzo-Hernández convictions on the hostage-taking counts, see\n\n18   U.S.C.   §   1203(a),   the   government   touts   three   items   of\n\nsupportive evidence:         the Mieses-Pimentel testimony that (1)\n\nLorenzo-Hernández was one of the “males” who regularly brought\n\nhim food in the rear bedroom during the three-day captivity at\n\nthe third residence; (2) Mieses-Pimentel saw Lorenzo-Hernández\n\nrunning with the weapons toward the rear of the house on that\n\nmorning, after the blindfold had been removed from Mieses-\n\nPimentel; and (3) Lorenzo-Hernández was the person who had\n\nremoved the blindfold and the handcuffs, escorted him from the\n\nrear bedroom to the other rear room, and told him to act like\n\none of them.\n\n\n                                    17\n\f         b.    Count 5:   Carrying Firearms\n\n         In relation to the Count 5 conviction for carrying\n\nfirearms, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the government relies on the\n\ntrial testimony that Mieses-Pimentel saw Lorenzo-Hernández run\n\nwith the weapons toward the rear of the house, whereas Lorenzo-\n\nHernández claims that Mieses-Pimentel never identified “who that\n\nperson was.”   As the record reflects that Lorenzo-Hernández\n\nfailed to preserve this claim in the district court,5 we review\n\nthe present challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence only\n\nfor plain error, see United States v. Upham, 168 F.3d 532, 537\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (“Sufficiency of the evidence objections are\n\nwaived, if not made below . . . .”).       Moreover, we will not\n\nreverse unless the conviction under Count 5 would result in a\n\n“clear and gross injustice.” United States v. Bello-Perez, 977\n\nF.2d 664, 668 (1st Cir. 1992);      see   Upham, 168 F.3d at 537\n\n(noting that the Olano plain-error test envisions clear showings\n\n\n\n    5Lorenzo-Hernández’s trial counsel advanced differing\ntheories in the Rule 29 motion than in his closing argument.\nSee United States v. Dandy, 998 F.2d 1344, 1356-57 (6th Cir.\n1993) (“Although specificity of grounds is not required in a\nRule 29 motion, where a Rule 29 motion is made on specific\ngrounds, all grounds not specified are waived.”). In fashioning\nhis “mere presence” defense, counsel allowed that Mieses-\nPimentel did identify his client as “the other person” running\ntowards the rear of the house with the weapons, see infra, but\ncontended that Mieses-Pimentel’s testimony was not credible\nbecause, inter alia, no law enforcement officer had seen anyone\nleave the residence and conceal guns in the backyard.\n\n                               18\n\fthat       the       evidence    was    obviously       insufficient       and    seriously\n\naffected the defendant’s substantial rights, as well as the\n\nfairness or integrity of the trial process) (citing United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-33 (1993)); see also United\n\nStates          v.    Todosijevic,      161     F.3d    479,    482    (7th      Cir.   1998)\n\n(“‘[R]equirements               for    plain    error    are    met    with      respect   to\n\nsufficiency of the evidence claims ‘if the record is devoid of\n\nevidence pointing to guilt, or if the evidence on a key element\n\nwas so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.’”) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n                 Notwithstanding the highly deferential standard of\n\nreview, the conviction against Lorenzo-Hernández under Count 5\n\nmust be set aside.                The case against Lorenzo-Hernández under\n\nCount       5    depended       entirely       upon    the   identification         Mieses-\n\nPimentel made of the person he saw carrying weapons shortly\n\nafter       law       enforcement       officers        arrived       on   the    premises.\n\nContrary to the government’s contention, Mieses-Pimentel did not\n\nidentify Lorenzo-Hernández as the person whom he saw carrying\n\nfirearms         on    that     occasion.6       Rather,       on   direct       examination\n\n\n       6\n      The government acknowledges that it adduced no evidence\nthat Lorenzo-Hernández ever “used” these firearms. See Bailey v.\nUnited States, 516 U.S. 137, 143 (1995) (“using” element under\n§ 924(c) contemplates proof that particular defendant “actively\nemployed” weapon). Thus, it relied exclusively on the theory\nthat Lorenzo-Hernández “carried” or transported the weapons on\nthis occasion. See United States v. Cleveland, 106 F.3d 1056,\n\n                                                19\n\fMieses-Pimentel        referred    to   the   gun-carrier     as   “the   other\n\nperson,” and on cross-examination simply as “someone.”\n\n            We cannot reliably determine, within the context of the\n\nMieses-Pimentel testimony, whether the term “the other person”\n\nadverted to Lorenzo-Hernández or to the second unidentified male\n\nyouth who was in the house on the morning in question, but not\n\nin the courtroom during the trial testimony given by Mieses-\n\nPimentel.7    Since Mieses-Pimentel, in his immediately preceding\n\ntestimony,    twice      used   the     phrase   “other   person,”    plainly\n\nreferring    to    a   different    individual    on   each   occasion,     the\n\nfollowing question — critical to the government’s case — went\n\nunanswered:       the person “[o]ther” than whom?         We explain.\n\n            First, Mieses-Pimentel testified that “[t]he other\n\nperson who is not here [in the courtroom] today” — i.e., plainly\n\nsomeone other than Lorenzo-Hernández – “had been the first to\n\nrun out of the rear room and surrender to the FBI. . . .”\n\nSecond, he stated that “the other person who was sitting next to\n\n[the female and baby] . . . [who] ask[ed] him not to move around\n\ntoo much” was the last to leave the room, leaving Mieses-\n\n\n\n1066-67 (1st Cir. 1997) (aff’d, 524 U.S. 125 (1998) (“carrying”\nelement of § 924(c) is satisfied by proof that defendant\ntransported firearm either in a vehicle or on person).\n     7\n     The record suggests, however, that the unidentified second\nmale was an unindicted minor.\n\n                                        20\n\fPimentel by himself.         Therefore, the latter person had to have\n\nbeen Lorenzo-Hernández, because only he could have been present\n\nboth at the time of the FBI raid and during the trial testimony\n\ngiven by Mieses-Pimentel.\n\n            Consequently, we can discern no rational means by which\n\nthe trial jury could have determined, beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\nwhether the “other person,” whom Mieses-Pimentel testified to\n\nhaving   seen     carrying       the   firearms      toward       the    rear   of   the\n\nresidence where Mieses-Pimentel was being held hostage, was\n\nLorenzo-Hernández or the unidentified male minor.\n\n            The    latent        inconsistency       in     the     Mieses-Pimentel\n\ntestimony    —    as   to   whether     one   or     two    persons       removed    the\n\nblindfold and escorted him from the rear bedroom — undermines\n\nthe jury verdict on Count 5 as well.                   If (as Mieses-Pimentel\n\ninitially testified) Male A came into the rear bedroom, told\n\nMieses-Pimentel        to   be    quiet,      took    off    the        blindfold    and\n\nhandcuffs, and escorted Mieses-Pimentel to another room in the\n\nrear of the house, and if (as Mieses-Pimentel later testified)\n\nLorenzo-Hernández was the person who escorted him from the rear\n\nbedroom to the other room in the rear of the residence, then it\n\nwould appear highly implausible, if not physically impossible,\n\nthat Lorenzo-Hernández was also the gun carrier described in the\n\ntrial testimony given by Mieses-Pimentel.                          This is because\n\n\n                                         21\n\fMieses-Pimentel saw the gun carrier just after his blindfold had\n\nbeen removed, but before Mieses-Pimentel was escorted to the\n\nother room in the rear of the residence.\n\n            Accordingly, the evidence strongly suggests that Male\n\nB — rather than Lorenzo-Hernández — was the “other person” whom\n\nMieses-Pimentel observed carrying the weapons     while Lorenzo-\n\nHernández simultaneously relocated Mieses-Pimentel to another\n\nroom in the rear of the residence.      Moreover, the government\n\ninvited these testimonial inconsistencies from Mieses-Pimentel,\n\nand absent any follow-up clarification by government counsel the\n\njury plainly lacked a rational foundation for determining which\n\nversion of these critical events was to be credited.   See United\n\nStates v. Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998) (“If the\n\nevidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict gives\n\nequal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of\n\nguilt and a theory of innocence of the crime charged, [we] must\n\nreverse the conviction.      This is so because . . . where an\n\nequal or nearly equal theory of guilt and a theory of innocence\n\nis supported by the evidence viewed in the light most favorable\n\nto the prosecution, a reasonable jury must necessarily entertain\n\na reasonable doubt.”) (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).    Given the state of the trial record, therefore, the\n\n\n\n\n                                22\n\fjury determination as to the identity of the gun carrier can\n\nonly have been based on sheer speculation.\n\n            Although the trial participants assumed throughout that\n\nMieses-Pimentel positively identified Lorenzo-Hernández as the\n\ngun-toter, the record is totally “devoid of evidence pointing to\n\n[Lorenzo-Hernández’s] guilt [on Count 5],” and the government’s\n\n“‘evidence    on   [that]   key    element   was    so   tenuous   that   a\n\nconviction would be shocking.’” Todosijevic, 161 F.3d 479, 482\n\n(citation    omitted). 8     Nor    can   these    deficiencies    in   the\n\ngovernment’s “linchpin” evidence be considered inconsequential,\n\n\n    8We note as well that customary appellate review and plain-\nerror review of “sufficiency” challenges differ only negligibly\nwhere the failure of proof on an essential element of the\noffense is total. See United States v. Dawlett, 787 F.2d 771,\n775 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"’It is the imperative duty of a court to\nsee that all the elements of [a] crime are proved, or at least\nthat testimony is offered which justifies a jury finding those\nelements.’ In this instance the insufficiency of the evidence\nmandates reversal since plain error has been committed in an\narea so vital to the defendant. Surely our concept of justice\nis violated when a man is convicted of a crime he did not\ncommit.”) (citation omitted); United States v. Spinner, 152 F.3d\n950, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (finding plain error despite\nunpreserved sufficiency challenge, since “[i]t would be a\nmanifest miscarriage of justice to let a conviction stand\n[where] the government failed to present any evidence on an\nessential element of the crime”); Beckett v. United States, 379\nF.2d 863, 864 (9th Cir. 1967) (finding plain error despite\ndefendant’s waiver of sufficiency challenge where \"there was no\nproof of one of the essential elements [of the charged\noffense]\"); accord United States v. Meadows, 91 F.3d 851, 855\nn.6 (7th Cir. 1996) (noting, in dicta, that “a complete lack of\nany evidence of one of the essential elements of a crime is not\nonly insufficient evidence, but too little evidence to avoid a\nmanifest miscarriage of justice”).\n\n                                    23\n\fsince the section 924(c)(1) conviction exposed Lorenzo-Hernández\n\nto a mandatory thirty-year prison term, see supra note 2, nearly\n\ntrebling the eleven-year sentence imposed for his hostage-taking\n\nconvictions under Counts 1 and 2.   As the conviction under Count\n\n5 constituted plain error, it may not stand.\n\n\n\n\n                              24\n\f         c.   The Hostage-taking Counts\n\n         The sufficiency challenge under the hostage-taking\n\ncounts poses a more formidable hurdle for Lorenzo-Hernández.\n\nAlthough there was insufficient evidence that he toted a weapon,\n\nthe record clearly reflects that the jury acted well within its\n\nprerogative in finding that Lorenzo-Hernández was not “merely\n\npresent” at the hostage-scene, but knowingly participated in the\n\nrelated conspiracy.\n\n         Mieses-Pimentel was held hostage for three days at the\n\nthird residence, where he remained blindfolded and chained,\n\nwhich meant that two males had to bring his meals and respond to\n\nhis “scream[s]” to use the bathroom.9     Yet more importantly,\n\nMieses-Pimentel testified that the same two males attended him\n\nthroughout his captivity at the third residence.   Furthermore,\n\nhe not only identified Lorenzo-Hernández as one of the two males\n\nremaining at the third residence on the final morning, but gave\n\nno indication whatsoever that any other male resided continually\n\nin the third residence.\n\n\n\n\n    9 Mieses-Pimentel also testified that Lorenzo-Hernández gave\nhim what the jury may have construed as an order. That is, when\nLorenzo-Hernández and Mieses-Pimentel were left alone in the\nrear room after Raimary Lavandier and the second male fled the\nhouse, Lorenzo-Hernández told Mieses-Pimentel not to move around\n“in case the FBI came inside they would think he was looking for\na gun and shoot us right there.”\n\n                              25\n\f             The circumstantial evidence thus strongly supported a\n\nreasonable inference that Lorenzo-Hernández was not only a long-\n\nterm resident, but one of the two males residing in the house\n\nthroughout Mieses-Pimentel’s captivity, and that he participated\n\nin the hostage-taking, at the very least as the victim’s guard\n\nand attendant.        See, e.g., United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d\n\n675, 678 (1st Cir. 1993) (rejecting “mere presence” defense, as\n\ncriminal activity took place in defendant’s residence, where he\n\nenjoyed “dominion and control”); United States v. Lopez, 944\n\nF.2d   33,   39     (1st    Cir.   1991)   (same);   cf.   United   States   v.\n\nBatista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1991) (“[I]t runs\n\ncounter      to     human    experience     to   suppose     that    criminal\n\nconspirators would welcome innocent nonparticipants as witnesses\n\nto their crimes.\").\n\n                  Therefore, in light of all the record evidence, the\n\nverdicts against Lorenzo-Hernández on Counts 1 and 2 must be\n\naffirmed, while the conviction under Count 5 must be vacated.\n\nB.     Failure to Employ Special Verdict Form for Count 5\n\n             Lorenzo-Pérez contends that the district court erred\n\nin failing to provide a special verdict form in relation to\n\nCount 5 — charging that he used and carried firearms (viz., a 9\n\nmm UZI, Ruger .367 revolver, and Smith & Wesson .357 revolver)\n\nduring the kidnaping — which would have required the jury to\n\n\n                                       26\n\findicate     precisely     which    of   the    three      weapons   he    used    or\n\ncarried.10       The district court later sentenced Lorenzo-Pérez to\n\na consecutive thirty-year prison term under Count 5, on the\n\nunderstanding that the jury must necessarily have been satisfied\n\nthat he used or carried the UZI (i.e., a “machinegun”), whereas\n\nhis use of the two revolvers (i.e., mere “firearm[s]”) would\n\nhave resulted in only a five-year prison-term enhancement.                        See\n\n18   U.S.C.      §   924(c)(1);    supra      note   2   (describing      pertinent\n\nsentencing enhancements).\n\n             As it was never raised below, we review the present\n\nclaim      for    plain   error,    employing        the    four-step       inquiry\n\nprescribed in Olano.       See United States v. Hernandez-Albino, 177\n\nF.3d 33, 37-38 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing United States v. Olano,\n\n507 U.S. 725, 732-33 (1993)):\n\n             First, an error must have been committed.\n             Second, the error must be plain or obvious.\n             Third, the plain error must “affect[]\n             substantial rights,” which generally means\n             that it must have been prejudicial. Finally,\n             because Rule 52(b) is discretionary, we must\n             be convinced that the error “‘seriously\n             affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public\n             reputation of judicial proceedings.’”\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n      10\n      Although Lorenzo-Hernández raises the same claim in his\nbrief, our vacatur of his conviction under Count 5 moots the\nclaim, see supra Section II.A.2.b.\n\n                                         27\n\f                Lorenzo-Pérez predicates the present claim on United\n\nStates     v.    Melvin,   27   F.3d   710   (1st   Cir.   1994),       where   the\n\ndefendants were jointly charged under section 924(c)(1) with\n\nusing or carrying six weapons, some of which were “firearms,”\n\nwhereas others were “machineguns” implicating the thirty-year\n\nprison term.         The defendants unsuccessfully sought a special\n\nverdict form which would have required the jury to specify which\n\nof   the   weapons     the   individual      defendants    used    or    carried.\n\nInstead, the district court instructed the jury that though the\n\nfirearm count listed the six weapons conjunctively, rather than\n\ndisjunctively, thereby apparently permitting the jury to convict\n\nonly if it were to find that the defendants had used all six\n\nweapons, the jury should read the “and” as “or,” and could\n\nconvict each defendant if it were to find that each had used or\n\ncarried “any one firearm” listed.             See id. at 713-14.         The jury\n\nreturned a general verdict finding defendants guilty under Count\n\n5.\n\n                At sentencing, the government urged the district court\n\nto impose the enhanced thirty-year prison term.                   Acknowledging\n\nthat it could not divine from the general verdict form whether\n\nthe jury had found that any defendant had used a “machinegun,”\n\nthe district court declined.              We affirmed.       See id. at 715\n\n“([T]he court’s instruction explicitly permitted the jury . . .\n\n\n                                        28\n\f[to] suspend[] their deliberations on the use of firearms once\n\nthey    concluded   that   these   experienced    criminals    must   have\n\ncarried at least a single gun . . . .”).         Nonetheless, Melvin is\n\nunavailing to Lorenzo-Pérez, since the claim of error was duly\n\npreserved in Melvin, whereas the present claim must be reviewed\n\nfor “plain error” in accordance with Olano, supra.\n\n           Furthermore, unlike the district court in Melvin, the\n\ndistrict court below did not instruct the jury to read “and” as\n\n“or.”    Instead, the indictment in the present case emphatically\n\nphrased Count 5 in the conjunctive (i.e., “using and carrying\n\nfirearms, specifically, a 9 mm UZI,. . . a Ruger .367 revolver,\n\n. . . and a Smith & Wesson .357 revolver”) (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the district court correctly instructed the jury\n\nthat there are two elements in subsection 924(c):               (i) each\n\ndefendant committed a crime of violence (i.e., the hostage-\n\ntaking), and (ii) “during and in relation to the commission of\n\nthat crime, the defendant knowingly used or carried a firearm.”\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n           Lorenzo-Pérez nevertheless insists that the jury charge\n\ngiven    below   necessarily   overrode   the    explicit     conjunctive\n\nphrasing utilized in Count 5.        We do not agree.       Instead, the\n\nchallenged instruction clearly informed the jury that it could\n\nnot convict any defendant under Count 5 if it were to find that\n\n\n                                    29\n\fthe defendant neither used nor carried              any weapon.        As the\n\ninstruction accurately defined the applicable law, the present\n\nclaim of error fails.\n\n             Lorenzo-Pérez suggests that other language in Melvin\n\nmandates     special   verdict   forms    in    these     cases;    thus,    the\n\nomission must be considered “obvious.”            On the contrary, Melvin\n\nsimply rejected the government’s contention that our decisions\n\nseverely     circumscribe   recourse     to    special    verdict    forms    in\n\ncriminal cases.    Moreover, we noted that the district courts are\n\nvested with discretion to employ special verdict forms in these\n\ncases — i.e., where a section 924(c) count lists both a regular\n\n“firearm” and a “machinegun.”       See Melvin, 27 F.3d at 716 n.10.\n\nThe   term   “discretionary”     rationally      cannot    be   redefined     as\n\n“mandatory.”     Thus, although Melvin vests district courts with\n\nthe requisite discretion, Lorenzo-Pérez failed to request a\n\nspecial verdict form, thereby forfeiting any opportunity to\n\nsatisfy the first two Olano criteria.\n\n             Furthermore, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated\n\nthat Lorenzo-Pérez used or carried the UZI.                     For instance,\n\nAcosta-Molina testified that Lorenzo-Pérez threatened him with\n\nthe UZI, calling it “The Silencer” for “people who talk.”                    The\n\nUZI was recovered after Mieses-Pimentel had been rescued.               Since\n\nthe jury — even assuming it had been provided with a special\n\n\n                                    30\n\fverdict form — undoubtedly would have found that Lorenzo-Pérez\n\nused or carried the UZI during the Mieses-Pimentel hostage-\n\ntaking, any possible error in failing to provide a special\n\nverdict form on Count 5 would not have ”’seriously affect[ed]\n\nthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of [these] judicial\n\nproceedings.’”      Hernandez-Albino, 177 F.3d at 38 (citations\n\nomitted); see, e.g., United States v. Edgar, 82 F.3d 489, 510\n\nn.15 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding no “plain error,” in view of\n\n“strong evidence of guilt,” even though an element of the crime\n\nwas not made known to the jury).\n\n           Next, Lorenzo-Hernández raises the distinct, though\n\nrelated, claim that the district court erred in failing to\n\ndefine the term “machinegun,” as used in subsection 924(c), so\n\nas to enable the jury to determine whether the UZI qualified.\n\nCf. supra note 10.       Following oral argument before this court,\n\nthe    United   States   Supreme    Court   held    that   the   statutory\n\nsentencing enhancement for using or possessing a machinegun is\n\nan element of the offense, for determination by the jury, rather\n\nthan   simply   a   sentencing     factor   for    determination   by   the\n\ndistrict court.     Castillo v. United States, __          U.S. __, 120 S.\n\nCt. 2090, 2092 (2000).       Although Lorenzo-Pérez has not raised\n\nthis claim in his appellate brief, he did note Castillo in an\n\ninformative motion.\n\n\n                                     31\n\f            We reject the resort to Castillo for several reasons,\n\nsee Fed. R. App. Proc. 28(j), even assuming Lorenzo-Pérez may\n\nclaim any benefit conferred by Castillo.                      See United States v.\n\nRandazzo,      80   F.3d   623,    631    (1st         Cir.     1996)    (generally,\n\nappellants entitled to apply law prevailing at time of appeal,\n\nrather than time of trial).          Plain-error review applies to the\n\npresent claim, even though the prevailing practice in the First\n\nCircuit at the time of the trial in the instant case was to\n\ntreat   the    “machinegun”       issue       as   a     sentencing      factor    for\n\nresolution by the district court, rather than an element of the\n\noffense for jury determination.               See Johnson v. United States,\n\n520 U.S. 461, 467-68 (1997).\n\n            In all events, Melvin explicitly left open the distinct\n\nquestion now raised by Lorenzo-Pérez, as to whether “the 30-year\n\nsentence could not be imposed because the jury had not been\n\nasked to decide whether those firearms were, in fact, automatic\n\nweapons.”       Melvin, 27 F.3d at 715, n.9.                      Thus, it cannot\n\nseriously be contended that it necessarily would have been\n\nfutile for Lorenzo-Pérez to assert the same claim at trial.\n\n            Moreover, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the\n\nfailure   to    instruct    the    jury       on   the    meaning       of   the   term\n\n“machinegun” overcame the first two Olano criteria, the Castillo\n\nclaim advanced by Lorenzo-Pérez nevertheless falters on the\n\n\n                                         32\n\ffourth Olano criterion.        Absent a “miscarriage of justice,”\n\ncriminal convictions are not reversed automatically even though\n\nthe jury was never instructed on an essential element of the\n\noffense.     See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 631 (finding no “plain\n\nerror,”    even     though   intervening        Supreme    Court    decision\n\ndetermined   that    “materiality”   is    element    of     offense   to   be\n\ndetermined    by     jury,   normally      an     omission     constituting\n\n“structural error” necessitating reversal of conviction).\n\n           The government adduced uncontradicted evidence that\n\nLorenzo-Pérez threatened Acosta-Molina with the UZI.               Moreover,\n\nneither Lorenzo-Pérez nor Lorenzo-Hernández explains why an UZI,\n\nas a specie of firearm, does not readily meet the statutory\n\ndefinition of “machinegun.”        Cf. infra Section II.C (treating\n\ndistinct argument that this UZI was inoperable; hence did not\n\nqualify as “machinegun”).       For the foregoing reasons, Lorenzo-\n\nPérez cannot demonstrate plain error.\n\nC.   Inoperable UZI as “Machinegun”\n\n           Lorenzo-Pérez claims that the UZI did not qualify as\n\na “machinegun” under section 924(c), as a matter of law, since\n\na weapons expert testified that it had been damaged and/or\n\n\n\n\n                                   33\n\fclogged at some time in the past, and could not be fired until\n\nrepaired.    We disagree.11\n\n            While appellant cites no authority for the present\n\nproposition, numerous decisions hold otherwise.            See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Adams, 137 F.3d 1298, 1299-1300 (11th Cir.\n\n1998);   United States v.     Hunter, 101 F.3d 82, 85 (9th Cir.\n\n1996);   United States v. Maddix, 96 F.3d 311, 316 (8th Cir.\n\n1996); United States v. Yannott, 42 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir.\n\n1994); United States v. Willis, 992 F.2d 489, 491 n.2 (4th Cir.\n\n1993); United States v. Ruiz, 986 F.2d 905, 910 (5th Cir. 1993);\n\nUnited States v. Buggs, 904 F.2d 1070, 1075 (7th Cir. 1990).\n\nNor have we found a reported decision to the contrary.\n\n            Although we have yet to decide the issue,          but cf.\n\nUnited States v. Veilleux, 40 F.3d 9, 11 n.1 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(questioning, in dictum, ill-advised government concession that\n\n§ 923(a) required proof that weapon was operable), we find the\n\nrationale adopted by our sister circuits plainly persuasive.\n\nSubsection    923(a)(23)   broadly    defines   “machinegun”   as   “any\n\nweapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily\n\nrestored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without\n\nmanual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.”               18\n\n\n    11As it poses an issue of statutory interpretation, the\npresent claim is reviewed de novo.      See United States v.\nRostoff, 164 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                 34\n\fU.S.C. § 921(a)(23) (cross-referencing 26 U.S.C. § 5845(b))\n\n(emphasis added).       As the UZI in question plainly met the\n\nrequirements of subsection 921(a)(23), we affirm Lorenzo-Pérez’s\n\nconviction and sentence under Count 5.12\n\nD.   Consecutive Sentences\n\n            Lorenzo-Pérez next contends that the district court\n\ncommitted reversible error in directing that the thirty-year\n\nprison term imposed under Count 5 run consecutively to the five-\n\nyear term imposed under Count 3, see supra note 2, since both\n\ncounts    alleged   subsection   924(c)   violations   arising   from   a\n\nsingle predicate offense,        i.e., the Mieses-Pimentel hostage-\n\ntaking.    As appellant failed to object at sentencing, we review\n\nfor plain error.     See United States v. Torres-Rosa, 209 F.3d 4,\n\n8 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      In a May 2, 2000, motion submitted prior to oral argument,\nLorenzo-Pérez purported to notify the panel of other case\nauthorities for a distinct proposition: that the government had\nadduced no evidence from which a jury might infer the requisite\nmens rea, i.e., that he knew the UZI he possessed came within\nthe definition set forth in § 921(a)(23). See Staples v. United\nStates, 511 U.S. 600, 604 (1994). Even if Staples were legally\nand factually apposite, which it is not, see United States v.\nShea, 150 F.3d 44, 51-52 (1st Cir.) (detailing reasons Staples\nrationale is inapplicable to § 924(c) offenses), cert. denied,\n525 U.S. 1030 (1998), appellant failed to raise this distinct\n“mens rea” argument in his appellate brief. Therefore, it has\nbeen waived. See United States v. Li, 206 F.3d 56, 57 n.1 (1st\nCir. 2000).\n\n                                   35\n\f         The government acknowledges that there is no authority\n\nfor imposing a consecutive thirty-year term.      Moreover, though\n\nwe have never addressed the issue, every circuit which has ruled\n\nto date agrees with the position urged by Lorenzo-Pérez.         See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Correa-Ventura, 6 F.3d 1070, 1085 (5th\n\nCir. 1993); United States v. Martinez, 7 F.3d 146, 147-48 (9th\n\nCir. 1993); United States v. Sims, 975 F.2d 1225, 1235-36 (6th\n\nCir. 1992); United States v. Freisinger, 937 F.2d 383, 391-92\n\n(8th Cir. 1991); United States v. Luskin, 926 F.2d 372, 376-77\n\n(4th Cir. 1991); United States v. Henning, 906 F.2d 1392, 1399\n\n(10th Cir. 1990).\n\n         Congress enacted subsection 924(c) principally as a\n\nsentencing-enhancement   mechanism   for   application   to   persons\n\nconvicted of underlying crimes of violence committed through the\n\nuse of firearms.    Nevertheless, the imposition of consecutive\n\nsentences under subsection 924(c) for using multiple weapons\n\nduring a single crime of violence would impinge upon fundamental\n\n“double jeopardy” principles.   See id.\n\n         Accordingly, we hold that the consecutive sentences\n\nimposed upon Lorenzo-Pérez for the two firearms convictions,\n\ninvolving but one hostage-taking, are to run concurrently.\n\nE.   The Severance Motions\n\n\n\n\n                                36\n\f            Finally, all four appellants claim that it was error\n\nto deny their motions for severance, which were based on their\n\ncontention that trial counsel for their co-defendant, Raimary\n\nLavandier,    unexpectedly       interposed          a    totally    antagonistic\n\ndefense in mid-trial, thus essentially assuming the role of a\n\n“second prosecutor.”       Appellants identify two specific claims of\n\nprejudice:    (1) that in opening and closing arguments, as well\n\nas in cross-examining Acosta-Molina, Lavandier’s counsel focused\n\nupon and vouched for Acosta-Molina’s testimony that Peña-Morfe,\n\nLorenzo-Pérez,      and    Peña-Lora         were    the    hostage-takers       who\n\nassaulted    him    violently,    brandished             various    firearms,    and\n\nrepeatedly threatened his life and that of Mieses-Pimentel; and\n\n(2) that Lavandier’s trial counsel ultimately utilized Acosta-\n\nMolina’s testimony in forging a defense of duress, i.e., that\n\nthe violent behavior of these appellants intimidated her into\n\ncommitting the offenses charged.\n\n            Appellants argue that such an antagonistic defense\n\nconstituted    a   per    se   ground    for        severance,      since   it   was\n\ninevitable that the jury would convict them were it to credit\n\nthe   prejudicial        allegations         Lavandier       made    against     her\n\nintimidators.      See, e.g., United States v. Buljubasic, 808 F.2d\n\n1260, 1264 (7th Cir. 1987) (noting that codefendant’s coercion\n\ndefense made severance “unavoidable”).\n\n\n                                        37\n\f          We review severance rulings for any manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion which deprived appellant of a fair trial and resulted\n\nin a miscarriage of justice.         See United States v. Magana, 127\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997).      As we have explained, however:\n\n          “[P]ersons who are indicted together should\n          be tried together[,] since [t]his practice\n          helps both to prevent inconsistent verdicts\n          and to conserve resources (judicial and\n          prosecutorial).      Thus,   when   multiple\n          defendants are named in a single indictment,\n          a defendant who seeks a separate trial can\n          ordinarily succeed in obtaining one only by\n          making   a   strong   showing   of   evident\n          prejudice. The hurdle is intentionally high\n          . . . .”\n\nUnited States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 325 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(emphasis added; citation omitted).            Moreover, severance is\n\nespecially disfavored in conspiracy cases.        See United States v.\n\nDiMarzo, 80 F.3d 656, 659 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          In order to gain a severance based on antagonistic\n\ndefenses, \"’the antagonism . . . must be such that if the jury\n\nbelieves one defense, it is          compelled to convict the other\n\ndefendant’.\"      United States v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70, 79 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (emphasis added; citation omitted).          Thus, for example,\n\nmere fingerpointing among codefendants — i.e., the familiar “he\n\ndid it, not I” defense — normally is not a sufficient ground for\n\nseverance.     See, e.g., Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534,\n\n538-39   (1993)    (declining   to   adopt   “bright   line   rule”   that\n\n\n                                     38\n\fconflicting      defenses    inevitably     require    severance);    United\n\nStates v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1992) (“The fact\n\nthat two defendants assert antagonistic defenses does not, per\n\nse, require severance, even if defendants are hostile or attempt\n\nto cast blame on each other.”).\n\n           The     present    record       discloses      nothing   remotely\n\napproaching a manifest abuse of discretion by the district\n\ncourt.     First, in her opening statement Raimary Lavandier’s\n\ncounsel expressly      flagged, for all to hear, the substance of\n\nher anticipated defense,13 yet appellants’ counsel interposed no\n\nobjection, let alone a motion to sever.            See Woods, 210 F.3d at\n\n78-79 (noting that defendant waives right to belated severance\n\nif   previously    placed    on   notice    of   nature   of   codefendant’s\n\nanticipated entrapment defense); see also United States v. Gio,\n\n7 F.3d 1279, 1284-85 (7th Cir. 1993); Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(5)\n\n(requiring that severance motions be presented prior to trial).\n\nWhen appellants finally moved for severance, government counsel\n\n\n\n      13\n      Lavandier’s counsel argued, in pertinent part: “If you\nbelieve the witnesses from the government then you will hear\nsome chilling evidence . . . . You are going to hear testimony\nabout how scared the victim was, you are going to hear how\nscared and intimidated his family was, and you are even going to\nhear about how scared and intimidated other participants in this\nkidnaping were. You are going to hear how the perpetrators of\nthis crime used guns, used other kinds of force, and used all\nkinds of means to instill fear, not only in the victim but also\namong the other people . . . .” (Emphasis added.)\n\n                                     39\n\fnoted   that   even    the    government     had   been    “aware   of    the\n\n[Lavandier] defense . . . since before the trial,” and expressed\n\n“astonish[ment] to find out [the codefendants] didn’t know what\n\n[her] defense was going to be.”        Nor have appellants shown cause\n\nfor their belated objections, which were not forthcoming until\n\nthe Acosta-Molina cross-examination.          See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(f)\n\n(requiring defendant to show cause for failing to move for\n\nseverance before trial); United States v. Munoz, 894 F.2d 292,\n\n294 (8th Cir. 1990).\n\n            Second, even if the severance claim were preserved, the\n\nrecord refutes the principal complaint advanced by appellants:\n\nthat Lavandier’s counsel somehow elicited additional inculpatory\n\nevidence    during    the    cross-examination     of     Acosta-Molina    by\n\nexceeding    the   scope     of   direct   examination.       For   example,\n\nappellants argue that Lavandier’s counsel “extract[ed] [Acosta-\n\nMolina’s] opinions and conclusions” concerning the purport of\n\nthe nickname given the UZI — “The Silencer” — whereas on direct\n\nexamination the prosecutor had merely elicited the nickname\n\ngiven the gun, “not what it was for.”         But in fact Acosta-Molina\n\nhad already testified that Lorenzo-Pérez threatened him with the\n\nUZI, called it “The Silencer,” and informed Acosta-Molina that\n\nit was “for the people who talk.”           The purport could not have\n\nbeen made much clearer.\n\n\n                                      40\n\f            Thus, the cross-examination by Lavandier’s counsel, as\n\nthe district court observed, was “basically a reaffirmation of\n\nthe    [government]      witness’s     testimony        [on    direct],”    neither\n\nadding to, nor subtracting from, the government’s case.                            See\n\nUnited States v. Arias-Villanueva, 998 F.2d 1491, 1506-07 (9th\n\nCir.    1993)    (finding      no   abuse    of    discretion      in     denial    of\n\nseverance motion where evidence supporting defendant’s duress\n\ndefense would have been admissible against her codefendant at\n\nseparate trial); see also United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408,\n\n1416 (1st Cir. 1997) (“[T]he level of antagonism in defenses is\n\nmeasured by the evidence actually introduced at trial; argument\n\nby counsel is not evidence.”).14\n\n            Finally, the Lavandier defense was not irreconcilable\n\nwith appellants’ defenses.            As the incompatibility of defenses\n\nis    measured   in     degree,     appellants     must       establish    that    any\n\nincompatibility was very substantial.                “To obtain severance on\n\nthe    grounds    of    conflicting      defenses,        a    defendant    has     to\n\ndemonstrate      that    the   defenses      are   so    irreconcilable       as    to\n\ninvolve fundamental disagreement over core and basic facts.”\n\nUnited States v.

Each case must be\nassessed on its own facts.\n\n                                        41\n\f(emphasis added); United States v. Luciano Pacheco, 794 F.2d 7,\n\n9 (1st Cir. 1986) (“[S]ince the need to believe one defendant\n\nover another will always occur in the face of antagonistic or\n\nfingerpointing        defenses,         this   requisite       credibility\n\ndetermination cannot be, and is not, the decisive factor.\n\nRather, the need for severance turns on the degree of conflict,\n\nand    the   extent   to   which   the    antagonism    goes   beyond   mere\n\nfingerpointing into the realm of fundamental disagreement over\n\ncore and basic facts.”) (emphasis added).\n\n             Foremost,     appellants     incorrectly   intimate   that    a\n\ncodefendant’s defense of duress necessitates a severance in\n\nevery instance.       See, e.g., United States v. Musquit, 191 F.3d\n\n928, 941 (8th Cir. 1999) (finding that defendant had not shown\n\nthat    “legally      cognizable     prejudice”    resulted      from   his\n\ninterposition of duress defense); Arias-Villanueva, 998 F.2d at\n\n1507; United States v. Villegas, 899 F.2d 1324, 1346 (2d Cir.\n\n1990) (“Nor is it sufficient [for severance] that one defendant\n\ncontends that another coerced him to engage in the unlawful\n\nconduct if the jury could believe both that contention and the\n\ncodefendant’s      defense     [of      nonparticipation].”)     (citation\n\nomitted); United States v. Almeida-Biffi, 825 F.2d 830, 833 (5th\n\nCir. 1987) (finding that “jury’s acceptance of [defendant’s]\n\n\n\n\n                                     42\n\fduress    defense   did   not   require   the   jury   to   disbelieve   her\n\nhusband’s defense [of nonparticipation]”).\n\n            In the cases cited by appellants, the defendants had\n\nintended to testify that they knowingly participated in the\n\noffenses, but not until after their codefendants had coerced or\n\nintimidated them.15       Were the jury to credit such a defense, it\n\nwould be logically compelled to find that the codefendants\n\nthemselves committed the crime which they coerced the defendant\n\ninto joining.\n\n            By contrast, while cross-examining Acosta-Molina and\n\nduring closing argument, defense counsel never conceded that\n\nLavandier had participated in the hostage-taking, let alone that\n\nshe had been coerced to do so by any appellant.               Instead, she\n\n\n\n     15See United States v. Serpoosh, 919 F.2d 835, 838 (2d Cir.\n1990) (reversing denial of severance motion where two defendants\nprovided   diametrically   opposed  versions   of  core   events\nunderlying drug transaction, each arguing in turn that the other\nhad coerced or tricked him into participating); United States v.\nPeveto, 881 F.2d 844, 858 (10th Cir. 1989) (reversing denial of\nseverance where defenses were “mutually exclusive,” in that jury\ncould not have believed each defendant’s assertion that he was\n“held against his will” at the scene of the crime if it had\nbelieved the codefendant’s defense that he was becoming a\ngovernment informant who “set up” drug dealers, and that he knew\nfor a fact that the defendant had purchased drugs); Buljubasic,\n808 F.2d at 1264 (noting that defendant first planned to testify\nthat he unwittingly participated in offense by delivering money\nto codefendant, but decided to put on defense that he knew he\nwas participating in a crime, but was intimidated into\nparticipation because of codefendant’s reputation for carrying\nguns).\n\n                                    43\n\ffocused her argument on a single defense; namely, that Lavandier\n\nwas “merely present” at the third residence (“[N]or did she\n\nparticipate in any significant way in this offense, other than\n\nbeing present and doing what she normally did . . . in that\n\nhouse.”)\n\n              In   recounting     the    government’s   evidence   that    the\n\nhostage-takers had intimidated Acosta-Molina, defense counsel\n\ndid not suggest that the jury necessarily should believe Acosta-\n\nMolina’s identification of appellants as the hostage-takers.\n\nRather,       in   the    main    she    suggested    that   Acosta-Molina’s\n\ndescription of the hostage-takers’ violent behavior (whatever\n\ntheir identity) was totally at odds with Lavandier’s passivity\n\nand benign presence at the scene of the crime (“[S]he didn’t\n\nparticipate with these kinds of [violent] people.”).                Defense\n\ncounsel likewise emphasized that Acosta-Molina had to muster all\n\nhis courage in order to request that his cohorts remove Mieses-\n\nPimentel from his house, and suggested that it was implausible\n\nthat      a    small     female   in    Lavandier’s   position   could    have\n\nwithstood such violent hostage-takers when they relocated the\n\nvictim to her residence.           Finally, defense counsel noted that\n\nLavandier, unlike the other hostage-takers, neither attended nor\n\ninstructed Mieses-Pimentel.             (“[She] never came into his room,\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f[she] never held a gun to his head, [she] never engaged in any\n\nkind of intimidation that he was receiving from his captors.”)\n\n               On the other hand, the primary defense advanced by\n\nappellants       was    that   they     never   participated    in    the   crime\n\ncharged;       i.e.,    that     Acosta-Molina     falsely     identified     and\n\nimplicated       them     in   the    hostage-taking.        Thus,    the   “mere\n\npresence” defense advanced by Raimary Lavandier did not depend\n\nupon        undermining    the       defenses   presented      by    appellants.\n\nLavandier neither testified, nor pointed to any evidence, for\n\nexample, that Peña-Morfe, Lorenzo-Pérez or Peña-Lora threatened\n\nher.        Cf. supra note 15.        Instead, she argued that regardless\n\nwhether Acosta-Molina and the other government witnesses were\n\ntelling the truth,16 the jury should not convict her, since her\n\nconduct was inconsistent with the profile of these defendants.\n\nAccordingly, denial of the belated motions for severance did not\n\nconstitute a manifest abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n      Appellants argue that Lavandier’s counsel vouched for the\ngovernment’s evidence in her closing statement: “I submit to\nyou that you ought to have total respect for what [Mieses-\nPimentel] testified to.” Appellants have wrenched the quoted\nstatement from its context.      Lavandier’s counsel had just\nfinished discussing Mieses-Pimentel’s testimony concerning\nwhether Lavandier had ordered him to be quiet, thus suggesting\nthat Lavandier was one of the hostage-takers, or had simply\nasked him to be quiet. Counsel in no sense suggested that the\njury credit any other part of Mieses-Pimentel’s testimony as it\npertained to Lavandier’s codefendants.\n\n                                          45\n\f           The   conviction   and   sentence     of   appellant   Lorenzo-\n\nHernández under Count 5 is hereby vacated, and the case is\n\nremanded   for   resentencing   on       the   remaining   counts.      The\n\nimposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment upon appellant\n\nLorenzo-Pérez under Counts 3 and 5 is hereby vacated, and the\n\nprison terms on these counts shall run concurrently.                 In all\n\nother respects, the district court judgment is affirmed.\n\n           SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    46\n\f",

Appellants challenge the\n\nconvictions and sentences imposed for their respective roles in\n\nan armed hostage-taking which took place in the District of\n\nPuerto Rico in 1997.    For the most part, but see infra Sections\n\nII.A.2.b & II.D, their appeals fail.\n\n                                  I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n          On August 17, 1997, appellant Peña-Morfe and a person\n\ncalled “Charlie” abducted Richardson Leo Mieses-Pimentel at\n\ngunpoint as he was leaving the Chris Café, a place of business\n\nowned by his family.      The abductors placed a hood over the\n\nvictim’s head, handcuffed him, and transported him to a private\n\nresidence, where he was interrogated regarding his family’s\n\nfinancial resources, then informed that his abductors intended\n\nto demand a $500,000 ransom from the family.        Throughout the\n\nensuing   ten-day   captivity,   Mieses-Pimentel   was   continually\n\nblindfolded, forcibly restrained (i.e., handcuffed in a bathtub\n\nor chained to a bed), and repeatedly threatened with death.\n\nFollowing three days of captivity at the initial site, during\n\nwhich the captors unsuccessfully phoned Mieses-Pimentel’s family\n\nto negotiate a ransom, another accomplice — Santiago Acosta-\n\nMolina — was recruited and Mieses-Pimentel was relocated at\n\nnighttime to the Acosta-Molina residence.\n\n\n                                  5\n\f            During the ensuing captivity, Acosta-Molina observed\n\nPeña-Morfe, Lorenzo-Pérez and Peña-Lora toting various weapons,\n\nincluding    revolvers,       while    placing    phone    calls   to   Mieses-\n\nPimentel’s family.          At one point, Lorenzo-Pérez threatened the\n\nnewly     recruited         accomplice,      Acosta-Molina,    with     an   UZI\n\nsubmachine gun, which he referred to as “The Silencer” used “for\n\nthe people who talk.”         Throughout this period of captivity, the\n\nthree defendants repeatedly assaulted Acosta-Molina with blows\n\nto the face and chest.\n\n            Three days later, at Acosta-Molina’s insistence, the\n\noriginal captors relocated Mieses-Pimentel to a residence in\n\nBarrio Obrero, informing him that he was being taken to the\n\nplace where he would be killed.                 Upon arrival at this third\n\nresidence,    Mieses-Pimentel         was    handcuffed,   blindfolded,      and\n\nchained to a bed in a rear bedroom.\n\n            At about the same time, an INS agent recognized Peña-\n\nMorfe’s voice from an FBI tape of a ransom call to the victim’s\n\nfamily.     After arranging a meeting with Peña-Morfe, the INS\n\nagent      placed     him   under     arrest.     Peña-Morfe   admitted      his\n\nparticipation in the abduction and led the FBI to the third\n\nresidence, where Mieses-Pimentel was being held hostage.\n\n            An FBI SWAT team surrounded the residence, demanding\n\nthat its occupants surrender.               At this point in time — having\n\n\n                                         6\n\fbeen relieved of the blindfold and handcuffs by his captors —\n\nMieses-Pimentel saw someone running toward the rear of the\n\nresidence carrying firearms (including a machinegun).         Then he\n\nwas escorted to a different room at the rear of the residence,\n\nwhere he remained in the custody of appellant Lorenzo-Hernández,\n\nRaimary Lavandier (who was carrying a baby), and a male youth\n\nwhose identity was not disclosed at trial.\n\n            Ultimately, Raimary Lavandier and the unidentified male\n\nyouth    abandoned   Mieses-Pimentel,   exited   the   residence,   and\n\nsubmitted to arrest by the FBI.       A subsequent search disclosed\n\ntwo revolvers and an UZI machinegun secreted in the backyard of\n\nthe residence.\n\n            The four appellants, as well as Acosta-Molina and\n\nLavandier, were indicted for conspiring to commit a hostage-\n\ntaking for ransom (Count 1), see 18 U.S.C. § 1203 (a), and for\n\naiding and abetting the hostage-taking (Count 2), see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> & § </span><pre class=\"inline\">2.1\n\n\n     1  The statute provides:\n\n            [W]hoever, whether inside or outside the\n            United   States,  seizes   or  detains   and\n            threatens to kill, to injure, or to continue\n            to detain another person in order to compel\n            a   third    person   or    a   governmental\n            organization to do or abstain from doing any\n            act as an explicit or implicit condition for\n            the release of the person detained, or\n            attempts or conspires to do so, shall be\n            punished by imprisonment for any term of\n            years or for life and, if the death of any\n\n                                  7\n\fPeña-Morfe and Lorenzo-Pérez jointly were charged with using or\n\ncarrying firearms during and in relation to a crime of violence\n\n(viz.,   the   hostage-taking)   (Count   3).

Nonetheless, it is\nsignificant that Acosta-Molina testified that he had visited the\nthird residence after Mieses-Pimentel was taken there. Acosta-\nMolina testified that he met Peña-Morfe and others there, but\nmade no mention of Lorenzo-Hernández.\n\n                                               13\n\f            A close review of the entire trial record discloses:\n\n(a)     ample      evidence        that     Lorenzo-Hernández       intended   to\n\nparticipate in the hostage-taking; and (b) insufficient evidence\n\nfor the firearm conviction under Count 5.\n\n            a.     The Evidence\n\n            The entire case against Lorenzo-Hernández rests on\n\nMieses-Pimentel’s eyewitness testimony concerning the events on\n\nthe final morning of his captivity, after the FBI had surrounded\n\nthe   third      residence    at    which       he   had   been   held   hostage.\n\nAccordingly,      we   scrutinize         the   trial   testimony   provided   by\n\nMieses-Pimentel.\n\n            Government counsel asked Mieses-Pimentel who had been\n\npresent during his three-day captivity at the third residence.\n\nMieses-Pimentel responded that he had heard the voices of a\n\nfemale, a baby, and “two male[s].”                   During that time, Mieses-\n\nPimentel was continuously blindfolded and chained to a bed in\n\nthe rear of the house.         These same “two male[s]” — though not\n\nthe female — had come into the bedroom on a regular basis\n\nthroughout his captivity, to bring food and escort him to the\n\nbathroom.\n\n            On the morning the FBI surrounded the house and called\n\nfor its occupants to surrender, one of these two males (we shall\n\nrefer to him as “Male A”) hurriedly entered the rear bedroom,\n\n\n                                           14\n\ftold Mieses-Pimentel to be silent, removed his blindfold and\n\nhandcuffs, then relocated him to another room at the rear of the\n\nhouse.\n\n           At trial, Mieses-Pimentel perfunctorily described Male\n\nA as “a younger guy with a dark complexion.”      Government counsel\n\nthen   asked   Mieses-Pimentel:    “What   else   did   [you]   see?”   —\n\npresumably, when Mieses-Pimentel reached the other room at the\n\nrear of the residence.      To which Mieses-Pimentel responded:\n\n“the other person, he was a young guy” (Male B?), the female,\n\nand the baby.      Government counsel then asked Mieses-Pimentel\n\nwhether he could identify “any of these people in the courtroom\n\ntoday.” Whereupon Mieses-Pimentel pointed out Raimary Lavandier\n\nand “the person sitting next to her,” whom government counsel\n\nidentified as Lorenzo-Hernández.\n\n           The ensuing testimony from Mieses-Pimentel exhibits a\n\nglaring inconsistency, however.        When asked what “the other\n\nindividual that you have identified sitting next to [Raimary\n\nLavandier]” — viz., in the courtroom, i.e., Lorenzo-Hernández —\n\nhad done once Mieses-Pimentel had been relieved of the blindfold\n\nand handcuffs, Mieses-Pimentel replied:       “He was the one that\n\ntook me to the back room and told me to sit down and to act like\n\nI was one of them.”\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\f         At first blush, the quoted testimony suggests that\n\nLorenzo-Hernández was Male A, identified earlier by Mieses-\n\nPimentel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">, as the only individual who had entered the\n\nrear bedroom after the FBI arrived.     However, when government\n\ncounsel asked Mieses-Pimentel whether the individual who had\n\nremoved the blindfold    was present in the courtroom, Mieses-\n\nPimentel responded:     “[n]o,” notwithstanding the fact that he\n\nhad testified earlier that a single individual — i.e., Male A —\n\nhad removed both his blindfold and the handcuffs, then escorted\n\nhim from the rear bedroom to a different room in the rear of the\n\nresidence.\n\n         Rather than resolving this testimonial discrepancy,\n\nhowever, government counsel asked Mieses-Pimentel to describe\n\nthe scene he encountered upon arriving in the other room at the\n\nrear of the residence.    Mieses-Pimentel responded that the four\n\npersons who were in the room with him were “real nervous,” and\n\nthe “girl” (viz., Lavandier) started to cry.    “The other person\n\nthat is not here today . . . got up and ran outside the room,”\n\nfollowed shortly thereafter by the woman carrying the baby.\n\n(Emphasis added.)   “The other person who was sitting next to her\n\n[viz., in the rear room, i.e., Lorenzo-Hernández] . . . ask[ed]\n\n[Mieses-Pimentel] not to move around too much in case the FBI\n\ncame inside they would think he was looking for a gun and shoot\n\n\n                                16\n\fus right there.”     Lorenzo-Hernández then “got up and ran outside\n\nand . . . left [Mieses-Pimentel] sitting there by [himself].”\n\n          When government counsel asked whether Mieses-Pimentel\n\nhad seen any weapons “[a]fter the blindfold was removed[,]” he\n\nanswered: “Yes, before they took me in the room [i.e., the rear\n\nroom to which he was relocated] I saw the other person.           He was\n\nrunning towards the back of the house and carrying some weapons\n\nin his hands.”      (Emphasis added.)     Mieses-Pimentel identified\n\nthese weapons as “a small machine gun” and the two firearms used\n\nto abduct him from the Chris Café.\n\n          With respect to the sufficiency challenges to the\n\nLorenzo-Hernández convictions on the hostage-taking counts, see\n\n18   U.S.C.   §   1203(a),   the   government   touts   three   items   of\n\nsupportive evidence:         the Mieses-Pimentel testimony that (1)\n\nLorenzo-Hernández was one of the “males” who regularly brought\n\nhim food in the rear bedroom during the three-day captivity at\n\nthe third residence; (2) Mieses-Pimentel saw Lorenzo-Hernández\n\nrunning with the weapons toward the rear of the house on that\n\nmorning, after the blindfold had been removed from Mieses-\n\nPimentel; and (3) Lorenzo-Hernández was the person who had\n\nremoved the blindfold and the handcuffs, escorted him from the\n\nrear bedroom to the other rear room, and told him to act like\n\none of them.\n\n\n                                    17\n\f         b.    Count 5:   Carrying Firearms\n\n         In relation to the Count 5 conviction for carrying\n\nfirearms, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the government relies on the\n\ntrial testimony that Mieses-Pimentel saw Lorenzo-Hernández run\n\nwith the weapons toward the rear of the house, whereas Lorenzo-\n\nHernández claims that Mieses-Pimentel never identified “who that\n\nperson was.”   As the record reflects that Lorenzo-Hernández\n\nfailed to preserve this claim in the district court,5 we review\n\nthe present challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence only\n\nfor plain error, see United States v.

Therefore, the latter person had to have\n\nbeen Lorenzo-Hernández, because only he could have been present\n\nboth at the time of the FBI raid and during the trial testimony\n\ngiven by Mieses-Pimentel.\n\n            Consequently, we can discern no rational means by which\n\nthe trial jury could have determined, beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\nwhether the “other person,” whom Mieses-Pimentel testified to\n\nhaving   seen     carrying       the   firearms      toward       the    rear   of   the\n\nresidence where Mieses-Pimentel was being held hostage, was\n\nLorenzo-Hernández or the unidentified male minor.\n\n            The    latent        inconsistency       in     the     Mieses-Pimentel\n\ntestimony    —    as   to   whether     one   or     two    persons       removed    the\n\nblindfold and escorted him from the rear bedroom — undermines\n\nthe jury verdict on Count 5 as well.                   If (as Mieses-Pimentel\n\ninitially testified) Male A came into the rear bedroom, told\n\nMieses-Pimentel        to   be    quiet,      took    off    the        blindfold    and\n\nhandcuffs, and escorted Mieses-Pimentel to another room in the\n\nrear of the house, and if (as Mieses-Pimentel later testified)\n\nLorenzo-Hernández was the person who escorted him from the rear\n\nbedroom to the other room in the rear of the residence, then it\n\nwould appear highly implausible, if not physically impossible,\n\nthat Lorenzo-Hernández was also the gun carrier described in the\n\ntrial testimony given by Mieses-Pimentel.                          This is because\n\n\n                                         21\n\fMieses-Pimentel saw the gun carrier just after his blindfold had\n\nbeen removed, but before Mieses-Pimentel was escorted to the\n\nother room in the rear of the residence.\n\n            Accordingly, the evidence strongly suggests that Male\n\nB — rather than Lorenzo-Hernández — was the “other person” whom\n\nMieses-Pimentel observed carrying the weapons     while Lorenzo-\n\nHernández simultaneously relocated Mieses-Pimentel to another\n\nroom in the rear of the residence.      Moreover, the government\n\ninvited these testimonial inconsistencies from Mieses-Pimentel,\n\nand absent any follow-up clarification by government counsel the\n\njury plainly lacked a rational foundation for determining which\n\nversion of these critical events was to be credited.

The Hostage-taking Counts\n\n         The sufficiency challenge under the hostage-taking\n\ncounts poses a more formidable hurdle for Lorenzo-Hernández.\n\nAlthough there was insufficient evidence that he toted a weapon,\n\nthe record clearly reflects that the jury acted well within its\n\nprerogative in finding that Lorenzo-Hernández was not “merely\n\npresent” at the hostage-scene, but knowingly participated in the\n\nrelated conspiracy.\n\n         Mieses-Pimentel was held hostage for three days at the\n\nthird residence, where he remained blindfolded and chained,\n\nwhich meant that two males had to bring his meals and respond to\n\nhis “scream[s]” to use the bathroom.9     Yet more importantly,\n\nMieses-Pimentel testified that the same two males attended him\n\nthroughout his captivity at the third residence.   Furthermore,\n\nhe not only identified Lorenzo-Hernández as one of the two males\n\nremaining at the third residence on the final morning, but gave\n\nno indication whatsoever that any other male resided continually\n\nin the third residence.\n\n\n\n\n    9 Mieses-Pimentel also testified that Lorenzo-Hernández gave\nhim what the jury may have construed as an order. That is, when\nLorenzo-Hernández and Mieses-Pimentel were left alone in the\nrear room after Raimary Lavandier and the second male fled the\nhouse, Lorenzo-Hernández told Mieses-Pimentel not to move around\n“in case the FBI came inside they would think he was looking for\na gun and shoot us right there.”\n\n                              25\n\f             The circumstantial evidence thus strongly supported a\n\nreasonable inference that Lorenzo-Hernández was not only a long-\n\nterm resident, but one of the two males residing in the house\n\nthroughout Mieses-Pimentel’s captivity, and that he participated\n\nin the hostage-taking, at the very least as the victim’s guard\n\nand attendant.

Moreover, we noted that the district courts are\n\nvested with discretion to employ special verdict forms in these\n\ncases — i.e., where a section 924(c) count lists both a regular\n\n“firearm” and a “machinegun.”       See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195440\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Melvin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195440/united-states-v-melvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">716</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">n.10.\n\nThe   term   “discretionary”     rationally      cannot    be   redefined     as\n\n“mandatory.”     Thus, although Melvin vests district courts with\n\nthe requisite discretion, Lorenzo-Pérez failed to request a\n\nspecial verdict form, thereby forfeiting any opportunity to\n\nsatisfy the first two Olano criteria.\n\n             Furthermore, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated\n\nthat Lorenzo-Pérez used or carried the UZI.

For   example,\n\nappellants argue that Lavandier’s counsel “extract[ed] [Acosta-\n\nMolina’s] opinions and conclusions” concerning the purport of\n\nthe nickname given the UZI — “The Silencer” — whereas on direct\n\nexamination the prosecutor had merely elicited the nickname\n\ngiven the gun, “not what it was for.”         But in fact Acosta-Molina\n\nhad already testified that Lorenzo-Pérez threatened him with the\n\nUZI, called it “The Silencer,” and informed Acosta-Molina that\n\nit was “for the people who talk.”           The purport could not have\n\nbeen made much clearer.\n\n\n                                      40\n\f            Thus, the cross-examination by Lavandier’s counsel, as\n\nthe district court observed, was “basically a reaffirmation of\n\nthe    [government]      witness’s     testimony        [on    direct],”    neither\n\nadding to, nor subtracting from, the government’s case.

Defense\n\ncounsel likewise emphasized that Acosta-Molina had to muster all\n\nhis courage in order to request that his cohorts remove Mieses-\n\nPimentel from his house, and suggested that it was implausible\n\nthat      a    small     female   in    Lavandier’s   position   could    have\n\nwithstood such violent hostage-takers when they relocated the\n\nvictim to her residence.           Finally, defense counsel noted that\n\nLavandier, unlike the other hostage-takers, neither attended nor\n\ninstructed Mieses-Pimentel.             (“[She] never came into his room,\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f[she] never held a gun to his head, [she] never engaged in any\n\nkind of intimidation that he was receiving from his captors.”)\n\n               On the other hand, the primary defense advanced by\n\nappellants       was    that   they     never   participated    in    the   crime\n\ncharged;       i.e.,    that     Acosta-Molina     falsely     identified     and\n\nimplicated       them     in   the    hostage-taking.        Thus,    the   “mere\n\npresence” defense advanced by Raimary Lavandier did not depend\n\nupon        undermining    the       defenses   presented      by    appellants.\n\nLavandier neither testified, nor pointed to any evidence, for\n\nexample, that Peña-Morfe, Lorenzo-Pérez or Peña-Lora threatened\n\nher.        Cf. supra note 15.        Instead, she argued that regardless\n\nwhether Acosta-Molina and the other government witnesses were\n\ntelling the truth,16 the jury should not convict her, since her\n\nconduct was inconsistent with the profile of these defendants.\n\nAccordingly, denial of the belated motions for severance did not\n\nconstitute a manifest abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n      Appellants argue that Lavandier’s counsel vouched for the\ngovernment’s evidence in her closing statement: “I submit to\nyou that you ought to have total respect for what [Mieses-\nPimentel] testified to.” Appellants have wrenched the quoted\nstatement from its context.      Lavandier’s counsel had just\nfinished discussing Mieses-Pimentel’s testimony concerning\nwhether Lavandier had ordered him to be quiet, thus suggesting\nthat Lavandier was one of the hostage-takers, or had simply\nasked him to be quiet. Counsel in no sense suggested that the\njury credit any other part of Mieses-Pimentel’s testimony as it\npertained to Lavandier’s codefendants.\n\n                                          45\n\f           The   conviction   and   sentence     of   appellant   Lorenzo-\n\nHernández under Count 5 is hereby vacated, and the case is\n\nremanded   for   resentencing   on       the   remaining   counts.
