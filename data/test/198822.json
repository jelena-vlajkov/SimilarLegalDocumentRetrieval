Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                     Before\r\n\n            Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n  Campbell and Wallace, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\nLaura Maldonado-Rodrguez, by appointment of the Court, for\r\nappellant.\r\nMiguel A. Pereira, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Chief\r\nCriminal Division, Nelson Prez-Sosa and Michelle Morales,\r\nAssistant United States Attorneys were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n               February 15, 2000\r\n\n                                           WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge.  Giovanni Hernndez-Garca\r\nwas tried and convicted of conspiracy to distribute more than five\r\nkilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841, 846.  The\r\ndistrict court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  3231.  His\r\nappeal was timely filed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C.  1291.  We affirm.\r\n                       I.\r\nHernndez-Garca first argues that he received\r\nineffective assistance of counsel at trial because of a conflict of\r\ninterest with his attorney.  This conflict arose, Hernndez-Garca\r\nargues, because his counsel was unprepared, failed to file motions,\r\nand previously represented one of the cooperating witnesses who\r\ntestified against him.\r\nThis is not the proper forum to address an ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel argument.  Such claims \"will not be\r\nentertained on direct appeal absent a sufficiently developed\r\nevidentiary record.  Instead, a collateral proceeding under 28\r\nU.S.C.  2255 is the appropriate vehicle for such an\r\nineffective-assistance claim.\"  United States v. Ademaj, 170 F.3d\r\n58, 64 (1st Cir.) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 206\r\n(1999).  Hernandez's ineffective assistance of counsel argument is\r\nfact-intensive, making it more appropriate in a section 2255\r\nsetting.                               II.\r\nHernndez-Garca next argues that the district court\r\nerred in admitting tape recorded evidence against him without\r\nproper voice identification as required by Federal Rule of Evidence\r\n901.  We review for abuse of discretion.  See United States v.\r\nCitro, 938 F.2d 1431, 1438 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nBefore certain voice evidence is admissible, it must be\r\nauthenticated pursuant to Rule 901(a), (b)(15).  \"The rule does not\r\nerect a particularly high hurdle.\"  United States v. Ortiz, 966\r\nF.2d 707, 716 (1st Cir. 1992).  The burden of authentication \"does\r\nnot require the proponent of the evidence to rule out all\r\npossibilities inconsistent with authenticity, or to prove beyond\r\nany doubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.  Rather, the\r\nstandard for authentication, and hence for admissibility, is one of\r\nreasonable likelihood.\"  United States v. Holmquist, 36 F.3d 154,\r\n168 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nAt a Carbone hearing to determine the admissibility of\r\nwiretap evidence obtained during a Title III interception, see\r\nUnited States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1986),\r\nSpecial Agent Cintrn identified Hernndez-Garca's voice. \r\nHowever, shortly thereafter, he stated he was not sure of his\r\nidentification because the voice may have been that of another\r\ndefendant.  Regardless, Agent Cintrn testified that he presumed\r\nthat Hernndez-Garca's voice was on the recording based on\r\ncircumstantial evidence:  a speaker on the recording identified\r\nhimself as \"Vani,\" Hernndez-Garca's alias, and there was only one\r\n\"Vani\" investigated and indicted.\r\nAngel Ruiz-Adorno, a cooperating government witness, also\r\npositively identified Hernndez-Garca's voice after listening to\r\nthe recordings.  Hernndez-Garca attempted to impeach Ruiz-Adorno,\r\nleaving a credibility finding for the district court.  The district\r\njudge ruled that he was satisfied, based on Agent Cintrn's and\r\nRuiz-Adorno's testimony, that Hernndez-Garca's voice was properly\r\nidentified.\r\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion. \r\nCircumstantial evidence, either alone or in conjunction with direct\r\nevidence, is admissible for Rule 901 authentication purposes.  See\r\nUnited States v. Carrasco, 887 F.2d 794, 804 (7th Cir. 1989). \r\nThus, the district court properly relied upon Agent Cintrn's\r\ntestimony that the audiotapes identify \"Vani,\" i.e., Hernndez-\r\nGarca, and that there was only one \"Vani\" associated to the drug\r\nconspiracy in making his Rule 901 ruling.\r\nHernndez-Garca argues that Ruiz-Adorno could not have\r\nmet him at the time Ruiz-Adorno testified, but this was a\r\ncredibility issue to be resolved by the district court.  In\r\naddition, at no time did Hernndez-Garca foreclose the possibility\r\nthat Ruiz-Adorno actually met Hernndez-Garca at some other time\r\nprior to his positive voice identification at the Carbone hearing.\r\nFor these reasons, the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in determining that the audiotapes were properly\r\nauthenticated.\r\n                      III.\r\nHernndez-Garca also argues that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to find that he ever joined the conspiracy.  In making\r\nthis argument, Hernndez-Garca:\r\n             bears a heavy burden: he must show that no\r\n  rational jury could have found him guilty\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.  We review the\r\n  sufficiency of the evidence as a whole, in\r\n  a light most favorable to the verdict,\r\n  taking into consideration all reasonable\r\n  inferences.  We resolve all credibility\r\n  issues in favor of the verdict.  The\r\n  evidence may be entirely circumstantial,\r\n  and need not exclude every hypothesis of\r\n  innocence; that is, the factfinder may\r\n  decide among reasonable interpretations of\r\n  the evidence.\r\n\nUnited States v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1999)\r\n(citations omitted).\r\nHaving reviewed the evidence as outlined above, we hold\r\nthat it was sufficient to uphold the jury's verdict.  Ruiz-Adorno\r\ntestified that he saw Hernndez-Garca give a bag full of money to\r\nWes Solano-Moreta, the head of the drug conspiracy.  The jury heard\r\ntwo audiotapes comprising conversations between Hernndez-Garca\r\nand Wes Solano-Moreta concerning drug trafficking.  It saw two\r\nvideotapes showing Hernndez-Garca at known drug distribution\r\npoints.  It also saw a photograph in which Hernndez-Garca is seen\r\nwith Wes Solano-Moreta.  FBI Special Agent Vzquez testified that\r\nduring an authorized wiretap of a beeper Solano-Moreta used, the\r\nbeeper received 192 messages from \"Vani.\"  The fact that much of\r\nthe evidence is circumstantial, and that the government did not\r\nidentify Hernndez-Garca's precise role in the conspiracy, do not\r\ndiminish the jury's finding of guilt.  See Scharon, 187 F.3d at 21\r\n(stating that jury can rely entirely upon circumstantial evidence);\r\nUnited States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 1996)\r\n(stating \"to prove a defendant guilty of a narcotics-related\r\nconspiracy the government need not specify and prove with\r\nparticularity the defendant's exact role in the scheme\").  The\r\nevidence was sufficient to uphold the jury verdict.\r\n                      IV.\r\nHernndez-Garca next argues that the district court\r\nerred in calculating his sentencing range.  He challenges the\r\ndistrict court's findings on drug quantities and role in the\r\noffense, contending that because the district court's findings are\r\nnot specific, we cannot properly settle the sentencing issue.\r\nIn United States v. Fal-Gonzlez, No. 98-1749, slip op.\r\nat    (collecting cases), a companion case, we held that if a\r\ndefendant is dissatisfied with the district court's sentencing\r\nfindings, he must request more specific findings at sentencing in\r\norder to challenge the findings on appeal.  Hernndez-Garca did\r\nchallenge the presentence report recommendation concerning drug-\r\nquantity and role in the offense.  However, after the district\r\ncourt heard evidence from both sides and made its findings\r\nregarding these issues, Hernndez-Garca offered no further\r\nobjections, despite the district court's asking three times whether\r\ncounsel had any further points to make.  Having failed to request\r\nmore specific findings in the district court, Hernndez-Garca\r\ncannot challenge the specificity of those findings here.  See id.\r\n                       V.\r\nFinally, Hernndez-Garca argues that the district court\r\nshould have granted his motion for new trial, brought pursuant to\r\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, based on newly discovered\r\nevidence that one telephone call recorded during a Title III\r\nintercept of Solano-Moreta cellular phone, and used against\r\nHernndez-Garca at trial, did not take place during the authorized\r\nintercept time.  The basis for Hernndez-Garca's argument is that\r\ncellular billing records, obtained after trial, do not indicate a\r\ncall being made on the Title III target phone at the time the\r\ngovernment maintains.  Hernndez-Garca's co-defendant Fal-\r\nGonzlez raised this identical issue.  See Fal-Gonzlez, slip op.\r\nat    .  For the same reasons stated there, we hold that there was\r\nno manifest abuse of discretion in denying the motion.\r\nAFFIRMED.\n",
