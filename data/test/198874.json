McCormick for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Stephanie S. Browne, Assistant United States Attorney and\nMargaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           April 5, 2000\n\f\f            STAHL, Circuit Judge.               Defendant-appellant Vladimir\n\nCabrera appeals his conviction for possession of a document-\n\nmaking implement under 18 U.S.C. § 1028 (1994 & Supp. 1996).\n\nSpecifically, he (a) asserts that under a proper interpretation\n\nof § 1028, the prosecution presented insufficient evidence upon\n\nwhich to ground a conviction and (b) challenges the district\n\ncourt's decision to limit the scope of cross-examination of a\n\nparticular government witness.              We affirm.\n\n                                  Background\n\n            In   early    1998,       Cabrera    and    an   accomplice,    Joseph\n\nMedeiros,    engaged       in     a     scheme     to     produce   counterfeit\n\nidentification     documents,         including    Massachusetts      and    Rhode\n\nIsland driver's licenses, Massachusetts and Rhode Island state\n\nemployee identification cards, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico\n\nbirth certificates, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nSocial   Security        cards,       and   U.S.       Department   of     Justice\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) Resident Alien\n\ncards.   The government's evidence supported the conclusions that\n\nCabrera employed a computer, a document scanner, a printer, and\n\ncommercial software that together could be used to scan, alter,\n\nand reproduce documents.              When used in conjunction with this\n\nhardware and software, computer files containing previously\n\nscanned official documents stripped of all identifying material\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fserved   as    digitized   “templates”   from   which    forgeries   could\n\neasily   be     fabricated.     First,    using    the    aforementioned\n\nequipment, Cabrera scanned genuine documents into his computer,\n\nsaved the images on his computer hard drive and on floppy disks,\n\nremoved or altered the identifying information and photographs\n\non the documents, and then printed the documents on photographic\n\npaper.   Medeiros then inserted new identifying information onto\n\nthe documents, trimmed the counterfeits, and laminated them as\n\nappropriate.      Cabrera kept the computer equipment at his home,\n\nwhile the equipment Medeiros used was stored in a suitcase that\n\nthe two owned jointly.\n\n              On June 10, 1998, U.S. Secret Service Agents searched\n\nCabrera's apartment pursuant to a warrant.        They found Cabrera's\n\ncomputer equipment, a board used for measuring and trimming\n\ndocuments, Microsoft's “Picture It!” software, which Cabrera\n\napparently had used to create the counterfeit materials, the\n\ndigitized templates, and sundry fake documents in various stages\n\nof completion.\n\n              Subsequently, on January 20, 1999, a federal grand jury\n\nin the District of Rhode Island returned a two-count indictment,\n\ncharging, inter alia, that Cabrera possessed document-making\n\nimplements with the intent that such implements be used in the\n\nproduction of false identification documents, in violation of 18\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fU.S.C. § 1028(a)(5).     At the relevant time period, the statute\n\ndefined “document-making implement” to mean\n\n           any   implement  or   impression    specially\n           designed or primarily used for making an\n           identification      document,     a     false\n           identification    document,    or     another\n           document-making implement.1\n\nCount One -- the only count relevant to this appeal2 -- was based\n\non Cabrera's possession of the computer, printer, and scanner.\n\n\n\n           During Cabrera's trial, Secret Service Agent James\n\nMooney testified for the government regarding the templates\n\nfound on Cabrera's hard drive and on the diskettes.                Agent\n\nMooney   also   described    the   software   installed   on   Cabrera's\n\ncomputer and how it could be used for scanning, altering and\n\nreproducing     documents.    On   cross-examination,     Agent   Mooney\n\nacknowledged that computers were available to the public and\n\nthat they had uses aside from those of which Cabrera stood\n\naccused.   But when Cabrera's counsel then attempted to further\n\n\n     1\n     This language has since been amended and now defines\n“document-making implement” as “any implement, impression,\nelectronic device, or computer hardware or software, that is\nspecifically configured or primarily used for making an\nidentification document, a false identification document, or\nanother document-making implement.” 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(1) (1994\n& Supp. 1998) (as amended).\n     2\n     Cabrera was acquitted on a second count involving the\npossession of rub-on letters, a laminating machine, and plastic\nlaminating pouches.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fexamine him regarding the general uses to which anyone could put\n\ncomputer equipment, the court intervened, and the following\n\nsidebar exchange regarding the meaning of § 1028's “primarily\n\nused” prong ensued:\n\n          THE COURT: Congress might have been a little\n          bit more precise in their definition, but as\n          I read that definition in the context of\n          this statute, I read it as referring to the\n          possession and the intent of the possessor\n          in putting it to use. So I think that the\n          general use that anyone might put a computer\n          to -- in this case, a computer to, is not\n          relevant.\n\n          . . . .\n\n          MR. McCORMICK [Cabrera's Counsel]: I wanted\n          to ask generally if [computer equipment] was\n          primarily used for the making of --\n\n          THE COURT: No, because that primarily refers\n          to the possession of this individual, not\n          the general public.\n\n          At the trial's close, the district court instructed the\n\njury only that:\n\n          [a]s used in these instructions, the term\n          “document   making   implement”  means   any\n          implement or impression specially designed\n          or   primarily     used   for   making    an\n          identification      document,    a     false\n          identification document or another document\n          making implement.\n\nThe instructions did not specify any particular meaning for the\n\nterms   “specially   designed”   or    “primarily   used.”   Although\n\nCabrera's counsel did not object to these instructions, the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fgovernment did object, stating that they did not adequately\n\nspecify that the statute referred to Cabrera's primary use of\n\nthe equipment rather than the general uses to which any computer\n\nuser primarily would put such equipment.\n\n           Meanwhile, Cabrera had moved for judgment of acquittal\n\non both counts, arguing that “on the evidence presented, it\n\nha[d] not been shown that the computer, printer and scanner\n\nreferred     to   in    the    indictment      [we]re    document   making\n\nimplements.”      The   district    judge     reserved   judgment   on   the\n\nmotion.    On May 21, 1999, the jury convicted Cabrera on Count\n\nOne, and the district judge denied his motion for a judgment of\n\nacquittal on that count.        Cabrera appeals.\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n           We address, in turn, the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting     Cabrera's      conviction    and   the    district   court's\n\ndecision to curtail Cabrera's cross-examination of Agent Mooney.\n\nBoth issues turn on the interpretation of former 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1028.\n\nI.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Cabrera argues first that his computer system was not\n\nproven to constitute a document-making implement within the\n\nmeaning of the statute, because “there was no proof, either\n\ndirectly [sic] or by inference, that [it] was . . . specially\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdesigned or generally used to produce identification documents,\n\nfalse    identification           documents        or    other     document         making\n\nimplements.” (Emphasis added.)                To determine the sufficiency of\n\nthe     evidence,      we      \"canvass           the    evidence       (direct        and\n\ncircumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution\n\nand    decide     whether     that      evidence,       including      all    plausible\n\ninferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder\n\nto    conclude     beyond     a    reasonable       doubt    that      the    defendant\n\ncommitted the charged crime.\"                 United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d\n\n490, 494 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n             A.    “Specially Designed”\n\n             We    first    find     that     Cabrera's     computer         system   was\n\n“specially        designed”       for   the     production       of    identification\n\ndocuments.        As an initial matter, we hold that the statute's\n\ntext    is   unambiguous.          It    does     not    exclude      from    its   reach\n\nimplements that could have legitimate other uses if not altered\n\nby the perpetrator's modifications.                     Cabrera suggests that the\n\n“specially designed” prong refers not to a defendant's specific\n\nimplements, but to implements that                      as a class are uniquely\n\nconfigured to fabricate false identification documents.                                His\n\ninterpretation is not tenable.                Neither the statute nor Cabrera\n\nprovides any basis upon which a court could determine the proper\n\nlevel of generality at which to define the class.                             Should we\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\flook to the class of “computers fitted with scanners, printers,\n\ndocument-altering software and digitized templates”?                   The class\n\nof   all    “computers”?           All    “electronic     implements”?        All\n\n“implements” of any sort?                Nothing in § 1028 requires such\n\narbitrary classification.                Rather, the statute unambiguously\n\nasks the fact-finder to consider whether the item that the\n\ndefendant is charged with possessing was “specially designed”\n\nfor producing forgeries.\n\n             Asserting that the statute is ambiguous, Cabrera notes\n\nthat courts may look to a statute's legislative history when its\n\nlanguage     itself    is    not   conclusive     and    clear.      See,   e.g.,\n\nBurlington Northern R.R. Co. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 481 U.S.\n\n454, 461 (1987); Arnold v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 136 F.3d\n\n854, 858 (1st Cir. 1998).           But even if § 1028 were unclear (and\n\nwe   believe   it     is    not)   Cabrera's    resort    to   its   legislative\n\nhistory would be unavailing.               The House Judiciary Committee's\n\nreport on the False Identification Crime Control Act of 1982 --\n\nin which the disputed “specially designed” language was first\n\nintroduced -- stated that “the committee intend[ed] to exclude\n\nimplements     such    as    office      photocopying    machines,    which   are\n\ndesigned for more general and legitimate purposes.”                   H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 97-802, at 11 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3519,\n\n3530.      This language might support an argument that standard\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fcomputer equipment, bereft of any special-purpose hardware or\n\nsoftware, would fall beyond the statute's reach.                         Perhaps an\n\noffender   could,   it      would    seem,   have    used      an    ordinary    word\n\nprocessor and an ordinary printer with ordinary paper to produce\n\nfalse documents, just as an offender could have used an office\n\nphotocopier to do so, without having violated former § 1028.\n\nBut Cabrera's computer arrangement, unlike a standard office\n\nphotocopier,      was       specifically       designed             to   facilitate\n\ncounterfeiting.         A   modern    computer      is   not    analogous       to    an\n\n“office photocopying machine[]” circa 1982, which in Congress's\n\nview likely could not be altered or specialized, but rather to\n\na modern photocopier fitted with software and hardware that\n\nrender it uniquely suited to produce illicit materials.                     We have\n\nno reason to believe that such a device would escape § 1028's\n\nreach simply because both it and its 1982 analogue were called\n\n“photocopiers.”     A photocopier configured with special-purpose\n\nhardware   or   software      may    be   “specially        designed”      for       the\n\nfabrication of identifying documents, and so may a similarly\n\nconfigured computer.\n\n           In fact, the more relevant portion of the legislative\n\nhistory is that which precedes the language quoted above.                            The\n\nHouse committee report noted that the term “document-making\n\nimplement” would include “text in a distinctive type face and\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\flayout that when reproduced [is] part of an identification\n\ndocument.”      Id.       This statement, of course, accurately describes\n\nthe   templates,          which    were    merely      computer       files   containing\n\ndigital images of “text in a distinctive type face and layout.”\n\nAlone, each template formed “part of an identification document”\n\nand together with the inserted data, each would constitute a\n\ncomplete document.\n\n            Cabrera contends that his system was not specially\n\ndesigned for the fabrication of false identification documents,\n\nemphasizing that the hardware at issue -- namely, the computer,\n\nprinter,    and      scanner       --     were   not       uniquely     suited   to   such\n\nactivity.       However, the evidence adduced at trial permitted a\n\njury to conclude that Cabrera's system also included software,\n\nsuch as the “Picture It!” program, which testimony indicated\n\n“could be used . . . to accept scann[ed] images and also to\n\nplace those images onto computer-produced documents.”                                 Most\n\ntellingly,      the       system    also    included        digitized     templates     of\n\nvarious official identification documents stored on Cabrera's\n\nhard drive and floppy disks.                A jury viewing this paraphernalia\n\nas a whole could reasonably have deemed the system “specially\n\ndesigned    .    .    .    for     making    .     .   .    a   false    identification\n\ndocument.”\n\n\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\f            B.        “Primarily Used”3\n\n            Cabrera urges that the “primarily used” prong of the\n\n“document-making            implement”    definition   refers     to    an     item's\n\n“general    usage”       rather    than    the   particular     use    to    which   a\n\ndefendant put it.            The government acknowledges that if it was\n\nrequired to prove that as a general matter, computers, scanners,\n\nand   printers        are    primarily    used   for   making    identification\n\ndocuments        or     false     identification       documents,           Cabrera's\n\nconviction must be overturned because the court was presented\n\nwith no evidence supporting that conclusion.                     The government\n\ncontends, however, that the relevant inquiry focuses not on the\n\nuses of some hypothetical user, but on Cabrera's own primary use\n\nof the computer system.             We share the government's view, and\n\nfind that a jury reasonably could have found that Cabrera's\n\nequipment was “primarily used” for the fabrication of documents\n\nas that term is set forth in former § 1028.\n\n            First, as the government notes, Congress could have\n\nused a word such as “generally” in lieu of “primarily” if it\n\nintended the meaning that Cabrera proposes.                   Congress's choice\n\n\n      3\n      Judge Lynch agrees with the foregoing analysis regarding\nthe “specially designed” prong. She also believes that a jury\nreasonably could have convicted Cabrera under the “primarily\ndesigned” prong, but would employ a standard different from that\nposited below. Thus, she joins the opinion to this point, as\nwell as Part II and the opinion's conclusion, but declines to\njoin this section.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fnot to use that term suggests that it did not intend the inquiry\n\nto focus on an item's typical use within society.               Relatedly,\n\nthe section's legislative history suggests that Congress fully\n\nexpected § 1028 to cover implements that were “generally” used\n\nfor purposes other than the fabrication of documents.            The House\n\nJudiciary Committee report noted that “specialized paper or ink”\n\ncould constitute document-making implements under the “primarily\n\nused” prong.     H.R. Rep. No. 97-802, at 11, reprinted in 1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 3530.   Paper and ink -- even “specialized” paper\n\nand ink -- are not “generally” used for the production of false\n\nidentification    documents,   but   could,   in   a    given    case,   be\n\n“primarily used” in the service of such ends by a particular\n\ndefendant.   The committee's remarks, then, lend credence to the\n\ngovernment's   case-specific   interpretation      of   the     “primarily\n\nused” prong.\n\n         Moreover, the treatment which former § 1028 has been\n\naccorded by the courts suggests that “primarily used” refers to\n\nthe defendant's primary use of the item in question.              While no\n\ncourt appears to have analyzed the meaning of this prong, it has\n\nbeen found to encompass an assortment of paraphernalia not\n\n“generally” used for illicit purposes, including laminating\n\nmachines, plastic laminating pouches, packets of rub-on letters,\n\nerasers, tape, scissors, and small photographs.                 See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fUnited States v. Castellanos, 165 F.3d 1129, 1130 (7th Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Pearce, 65 F.3d 22, 24-26 (4th Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n          Finally, as the government points out, at least one\n\nother statute with language similar to § 1028's has been treated\n\nin a manner consistent with the government's position here.   The\n\nstatute prohibiting fraud in connection with an “access device”\n\naddresses, inter alia, “device-making equipment,” and defines\n\nthat term to mean “any equipment, mechanism, or impression\n\ndesigned or primarily used for making an access device or a\n\ncounterfeit access device.”      18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(6) (1994 &\n\nSupp. 1998) (emphasis added).   The Eleventh Circuit, in applying\n\nthis statute, examined whether a defendant's mobile phone was\n\nprimarily used to make an access device or a counterfeit access\n\ndevice.   See United States v. Morris, 81 F.3d 131, 132-34 (11th\n\nCir. 1996).   Although the court ultimately found that it was\n\nprimarily used by the defendant for making telephone calls and\n\nthat it therefore did not fall within the ambit of § 1029(e)(6),\n\nthe court's very pursuit of the inquiry reflected its belief\n\nthat what mattered was the particular use to which the defendant\n\nput the device, not its “general” use within society.    See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f           The evidence showed that Cabrera repeatedly used his\n\ncomputer, scanner, printer, software, and digitized templates to\n\ncreate false identification documents.           This system was used in\n\nconjunction     with     laminates,    Exacto    blades,   a   supply    of\n\nphotographic-quality        paper,      and     genuine    identification\n\ndocuments.     There was no evidence to demonstrate that Cabrera\n\nused his system for any other purpose.          The jury thus reasonably\n\ncould have found that this equipment was “primarily used” for\n\nCabrera's document production.\n\nII.   Curtailment of Agent Mooney's Cross-Examination\n\n           Cabrera also challenges the district court's refusal\n\nto allow his attorney to cross-examine Mooney regarding the\n\n“primary     use”   to    which   other     individuals    generally    put\n\ncomputers.     In view of the preceding ruling, this testimony\n\nwould have been irrelevant, and therefore inadmissible.                 See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 401; Fed. R. Evid. 402.               “We generally will\n\nreverse a district court's admissibility determinations under\n\nFederal Rule[] of Evidence 402 . . . only in extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances.”        United States v. Rosario-Diaz, 202\n\nF.3d 54, 70 (1st Cir. 2000).            No such circumstances warrant\n\nreversal here.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f                        Conclusion\n\n         For the reasons stated herein, we   AFFIRM Cabrera's\n\nconviction.\n\n\n\n\n                           -16-\n\f",

Defendant-appellant Vladimir\n\nCabrera appeals his conviction for possession of a document-\n\nmaking implement under 18 U.S.C. § 1028 (1994 & Supp. 1996).\n\nSpecifically, he (a) asserts that under a proper interpretation\n\nof § 1028, the prosecution presented insufficient evidence upon\n\nwhich to ground a conviction and (b) challenges the district\n\ncourt's decision to limit the scope of cross-examination of a\n\nparticular government witness.              We affirm.\n\n                                  Background\n\n            In   early    1998,       Cabrera    and    an   accomplice,    Joseph\n\nMedeiros,    engaged       in     a     scheme     to     produce   counterfeit\n\nidentification     documents,         including    Massachusetts      and    Rhode\n\nIsland driver's licenses, Massachusetts and Rhode Island state\n\nemployee identification cards, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico\n\nbirth certificates, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nSocial   Security        cards,       and   U.S.       Department   of     Justice\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) Resident Alien\n\ncards.   The government's evidence supported the conclusions that\n\nCabrera employed a computer, a document scanner, a printer, and\n\ncommercial software that together could be used to scan, alter,\n\nand reproduce documents.              When used in conjunction with this\n\nhardware and software, computer files containing previously\n\nscanned official documents stripped of all identifying material\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fserved   as    digitized   “templates”   from   which    forgeries   could\n\neasily   be     fabricated.     First,    using    the    aforementioned\n\nequipment, Cabrera scanned genuine documents into his computer,\n\nsaved the images on his computer hard drive and on floppy disks,\n\nremoved or altered the identifying information and photographs\n\non the documents, and then printed the documents on photographic\n\npaper.   Medeiros then inserted new identifying information onto\n\nthe documents, trimmed the counterfeits, and laminated them as\n\nappropriate.      Cabrera kept the computer equipment at his home,\n\nwhile the equipment Medeiros used was stored in a suitcase that\n\nthe two owned jointly.\n\n              On June 10, 1998, U.S. Secret Service Agents searched\n\nCabrera's apartment pursuant to a warrant.        They found Cabrera's\n\ncomputer equipment, a board used for measuring and trimming\n\ndocuments, Microsoft's “Picture It!” software, which Cabrera\n\napparently had used to create the counterfeit materials, the\n\ndigitized templates, and sundry fake documents in various stages\n\nof completion.\n\n              Subsequently, on January 20, 1999, a federal grand jury\n\nin the District of Rhode Island returned a two-count indictment,\n\ncharging, inter alia, that Cabrera possessed document-making\n\nimplements with the intent that such implements be used in the\n\nproduction of false identification documents, in violation of 18\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fU.S.C. § 1028(a)(5).     At the relevant time period, the statute\n\ndefined “document-making implement” to mean\n\n           any   implement  or   impression    specially\n           designed or primarily used for making an\n           identification      document,     a     false\n           identification    document,    or     another\n           document-making implement.1\n\nCount One -- the only count relevant to this appeal2 -- was based\n\non Cabrera's possession of the computer, printer, and scanner.\n\n\n\n           During Cabrera's trial, Secret Service Agent James\n\nMooney testified for the government regarding the templates\n\nfound on Cabrera's hard drive and on the diskettes.                Agent\n\nMooney   also   described    the   software   installed   on   Cabrera's\n\ncomputer and how it could be used for scanning, altering and\n\nreproducing     documents.    On   cross-examination,     Agent   Mooney\n\nacknowledged that computers were available to the public and\n\nthat they had uses aside from those of which Cabrera stood\n\naccused.   But when Cabrera's counsel then attempted to further\n\n\n     1\n     This language has since been amended and now defines\n“document-making implement” as “any implement, impression,\nelectronic device, or computer hardware or software, that is\nspecifically configured or primarily used for making an\nidentification document, a false identification document, or\nanother document-making implement.” 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(1) (1994\n& Supp. 1998) (as amended).\n     2\n     Cabrera was acquitted on a second count involving the\npossession of rub-on letters, a laminating machine, and plastic\nlaminating pouches.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fexamine him regarding the general uses to which anyone could put\n\ncomputer equipment, the court intervened, and the following\n\nsidebar exchange regarding the meaning of § 1028's “primarily\n\nused” prong ensued:\n\n          THE COURT: Congress might have been a little\n          bit more precise in their definition, but as\n          I read that definition in the context of\n          this statute, I read it as referring to the\n          possession and the intent of the possessor\n          in putting it to use. So I think that the\n          general use that anyone might put a computer\n          to -- in this case, a computer to, is not\n          relevant.\n\n          . . . .\n\n          MR. McCORMICK [Cabrera's Counsel]: I wanted\n          to ask generally if [computer equipment] was\n          primarily used for the making of --\n\n          THE COURT: No, because that primarily refers\n          to the possession of this individual, not\n          the general public.\n\n          At the trial's close, the district court instructed the\n\njury only that:\n\n          [a]s used in these instructions, the term\n          “document   making   implement”  means   any\n          implement or impression specially designed\n          or   primarily     used   for   making    an\n          identification      document,    a     false\n          identification document or another document\n          making implement.\n\nThe instructions did not specify any particular meaning for the\n\nterms   “specially   designed”   or    “primarily   used.”   Although\n\nCabrera's counsel did not object to these instructions, the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fgovernment did object, stating that they did not adequately\n\nspecify that the statute referred to Cabrera's primary use of\n\nthe equipment rather than the general uses to which any computer\n\nuser primarily would put such equipment.\n\n           Meanwhile, Cabrera had moved for judgment of acquittal\n\non both counts, arguing that “on the evidence presented, it\n\nha[d] not been shown that the computer, printer and scanner\n\nreferred     to   in    the    indictment      [we]re    document   making\n\nimplements.”      The   district    judge     reserved   judgment   on   the\n\nmotion.    On May 21, 1999, the jury convicted Cabrera on Count\n\nOne, and the district judge denied his motion for a judgment of\n\nacquittal on that count.        Cabrera appeals.\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n           We address, in turn, the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting     Cabrera's      conviction    and   the    district   court's\n\ndecision to curtail Cabrera's cross-examination of Agent Mooney.\n\nBoth issues turn on the interpretation of former 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1028.\n\nI.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Cabrera argues first that his computer system was not\n\nproven to constitute a document-making implement within the\n\nmeaning of the statute, because “there was no proof, either\n\ndirectly [sic] or by inference, that [it] was . . . specially\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdesigned or generally used to produce identification documents,\n\nfalse    identification           documents        or    other     document         making\n\nimplements.” (Emphasis added.)                To determine the sufficiency of\n\nthe     evidence,      we      \"canvass           the    evidence       (direct        and\n\ncircumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution\n\nand    decide     whether     that      evidence,       including      all    plausible\n\ninferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder\n\nto    conclude     beyond     a    reasonable       doubt    that      the    defendant\n\ncommitted the charged crime.\"                 United States v. Noah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197675\"><a href=\"/opinion/197675/united-states-v-noah/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n             A.    “Specially Designed”\n\n             We    first    find     that     Cabrera's     computer         system   was\n\n“specially        designed”       for   the     production       of    identification\n\ndocuments.        As an initial matter, we hold that the statute's\n\ntext    is   unambiguous.          It    does     not    exclude      from    its   reach\n\nimplements that could have legitimate other uses if not altered\n\nby the perpetrator's modifications.                     Cabrera suggests that the\n\n“specially designed” prong refers not to a defendant's specific\n\nimplements, but to implements that                      as a class are uniquely\n\nconfigured to fabricate false identification documents.                                His\n\ninterpretation is not tenable.                Neither the statute nor Cabrera\n\nprovides any basis upon which a court could determine the proper\n\nlevel of generality at which to define the class.                             Should we\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\flook to the class of “computers fitted with scanners, printers,\n\ndocument-altering software and digitized templates”?                   The class\n\nof   all    “computers”?           All    “electronic     implements”?        All\n\n“implements” of any sort?                Nothing in § 1028 requires such\n\narbitrary classification.                Rather, the statute unambiguously\n\nasks the fact-finder to consider whether the item that the\n\ndefendant is charged with possessing was “specially designed”\n\nfor producing forgeries.\n\n             Asserting that the statute is ambiguous, Cabrera notes\n\nthat courts may look to a statute's legislative history when its\n\nlanguage     itself    is    not   conclusive     and    clear.

But even if § 1028 were unclear (and\n\nwe   believe   it     is    not)   Cabrera's    resort    to   its   legislative\n\nhistory would be unavailing.               The House Judiciary Committee's\n\nreport on the False Identification Crime Control Act of 1982 --\n\nin which the disputed “specially designed” language was first\n\nintroduced -- stated that “the committee intend[ed] to exclude\n\nimplements     such    as    office      photocopying    machines,    which   are\n\ndesigned for more general and legitimate purposes.”                   H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 97-802, at 11 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3519,\n\n3530.      This language might support an argument that standard\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fcomputer equipment, bereft of any special-purpose hardware or\n\nsoftware, would fall beyond the statute's reach.                         Perhaps an\n\noffender   could,   it      would    seem,   have    used      an    ordinary    word\n\nprocessor and an ordinary printer with ordinary paper to produce\n\nfalse documents, just as an offender could have used an office\n\nphotocopier to do so, without having violated former § 1028.\n\nBut Cabrera's computer arrangement, unlike a standard office\n\nphotocopier,      was       specifically       designed             to   facilitate\n\ncounterfeiting.         A   modern    computer      is   not    analogous       to    an\n\n“office photocopying machine[]” circa 1982, which in Congress's\n\nview likely could not be altered or specialized, but rather to\n\na modern photocopier fitted with software and hardware that\n\nrender it uniquely suited to produce illicit materials.                     We have\n\nno reason to believe that such a device would escape § 1028's\n\nreach simply because both it and its 1982 analogue were called\n\n“photocopiers.”     A photocopier configured with special-purpose\n\nhardware   or   software      may    be   “specially        designed”      for       the\n\nfabrication of identifying documents, and so may a similarly\n\nconfigured computer.\n\n           In fact, the more relevant portion of the legislative\n\nhistory is that which precedes the language quoted above.                            The\n\nHouse committee report noted that the term “document-making\n\nimplement” would include “text in a distinctive type face and\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\flayout that when reproduced [is] part of an identification\n\ndocument.”      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>       This statement, </span><pre class=\"inline\">of course, accurately describes\n\nthe   templates,          which    were    merely      computer       files   containing\n\ndigital images of “text in a distinctive type face and layout.”\n\nAlone, each template formed “part of an identification document”\n\nand together with the inserted data, each would constitute a\n\ncomplete document.\n\n            Cabrera contends that his system was not specially\n\ndesigned for the fabrication of false identification documents,\n\nemphasizing that the hardware at issue -- namely, the computer,\n\nprinter,    and      scanner       --     were   not       uniquely     suited   to   such\n\nactivity.       However, the evidence adduced at trial permitted a\n\njury to conclude that Cabrera's system also included software,\n\nsuch as the “Picture It!” program, which testimony indicated\n\n“could be used . . . to accept scann[ed] images and also to\n\nplace those images onto computer-produced documents.”                                 Most\n\ntellingly,      the       system    also    included        digitized     templates     of\n\nvarious official identification documents stored on Cabrera's\n\nhard drive and floppy disks.                A jury viewing this paraphernalia\n\nas a whole could reasonably have deemed the system “specially\n\ndesigned    .    .    .    for     making    .     .   .    a   false    identification\n\ndocument.”\n\n\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\f            B.        “Primarily Used”3\n\n            Cabrera urges that the “primarily used” prong of the\n\n“document-making            implement”    definition   refers     to    an     item's\n\n“general    usage”       rather    than    the   particular     use    to    which   a\n\ndefendant put it.            The government acknowledges that if it was\n\nrequired to prove that as a general matter, computers, scanners,\n\nand   printers        are    primarily    used   for   making    identification\n\ndocuments        or     false     identification       documents,           Cabrera's\n\nconviction must be overturned because the court was presented\n\nwith no evidence supporting that conclusion.                     The government\n\ncontends, however, that the relevant inquiry focuses not on the\n\nuses of some hypothetical user, but on Cabrera's own primary use\n\nof the computer system.             We share the government's view, and\n\nfind that a jury reasonably could have found that Cabrera's\n\nequipment was “primarily used” for the fabrication of documents\n\nas that term is set forth in former § 1028.\n\n            First, as the government notes, Congress could have\n\nused a word such as “generally” in lieu of “primarily” if it\n\nintended the meaning that Cabrera proposes.                   Congress's choice\n\n\n      3\n      Judge Lynch agrees with the foregoing analysis regarding\nthe “specially designed” prong. She also believes that a jury\nreasonably could have convicted Cabrera under the “primarily\ndesigned” prong, but would employ a standard different from that\nposited below. Thus, she joins the opinion to this point, as\nwell as Part II and the opinion's conclusion, but declines to\njoin this section.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fnot to use that term suggests that it did not intend the inquiry\n\nto focus on an item's typical use within society.               Relatedly,\n\nthe section's legislative history suggests that Congress fully\n\nexpected § 1028 to cover implements that were “generally” used\n\nfor purposes other than the fabrication of documents.            The House\n\nJudiciary Committee report noted that “specialized paper or ink”\n\ncould constitute document-making implements under the “primarily\n\nused” prong.     H.R. Rep. No. 97-802, at 11, reprinted in 1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 3530.   Paper and ink -- even “specialized” paper\n\nand ink -- are not “generally” used for the production of false\n\nidentification    documents,   but   could,   in   a    given    case,   be\n\n“primarily used” in the service of such ends by a particular\n\ndefendant.   The committee's remarks, then, lend credence to the\n\ngovernment's   case-specific   interpretation      of   the     “primarily\n\nused” prong.\n\n         Moreover, the treatment which former § 1028 has been\n\naccorded by the courts suggests that “primarily used” refers to\n\nthe defendant's primary use of the item in question.              While no\n\ncourt appears to have analyzed the meaning of this prong, it has\n\nbeen found to encompass an assortment of paraphernalia not\n\n“generally” used for illicit purposes, including laminating\n\nmachines, plastic laminating pouches, packets of rub-on letters,\n\nerasers, tape, scissors, and small photographs.                 See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fUnited States v. Castellanos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760898\"><a href=\"/opinion/760898/united-states-v-ruben-castellanos/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1130 (7th Cir.\n\n1999); United States v.

The\n\nstatute prohibiting fraud in connection with an “access device”\n\naddresses, inter alia, “device-making equipment,” and defines\n\nthat term to mean “any equipment, mechanism, or impression\n\ndesigned or primarily used for making an access device or a\n\ncounterfeit access device.”      18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(6) (1994 &\n\nSupp. 1998) (emphasis added).   The Eleventh Circuit, in applying\n\nthis statute, examined whether a defendant's mobile phone was\n\nprimarily used to make an access device or a counterfeit access\n\ndevice.   See United States v. Morris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70822\"><a href=\"/opinion/70822/united-states-v-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132-34 (11th\n\nCir. 1996).   Although the court ultimately found that it was\n\nprimarily used by the defendant for making telephone calls and\n\nthat it therefore did not fall within the ambit of § 1029(e)(6),\n\nthe court's very pursuit of the inquiry reflected its belief\n\nthat what mattered was the particular use to which the defendant\n\nput the device, not its “general” use within society.    See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f           The </span><pre class=\"inline\">evidence showed that Cabrera repeatedly used his\n\ncomputer, scanner, printer, software, and digitized templates to\n\ncreate false identification documents.           This system was used in\n\nconjunction     with     laminates,    Exacto    blades,   a   supply    of\n\nphotographic-quality        paper,      and     genuine    identification\n\ndocuments.     There was no evidence to demonstrate that Cabrera\n\nused his system for any other purpose.          The jury thus reasonably\n\ncould have found that this equipment was “primarily used” for\n\nCabrera's document production.\n\nII.   Curtailment of Agent Mooney's Cross-Examination\n\n           Cabrera also challenges the district court's refusal\n\nto allow his attorney to cross-examine Mooney regarding the\n\n“primary     use”   to    which   other     individuals    generally    put\n\ncomputers.     In view of the preceding ruling, this testimony\n\nwould have been irrelevant, and therefore inadmissible.                 See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 401; Fed. R. Evid. 402.               “We generally will\n\nreverse a district court's admissibility determinations under\n\nFederal Rule[] of Evidence 402 . . . only in extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances.”        United States v.
