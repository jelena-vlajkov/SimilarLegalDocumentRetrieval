ZAKI,\r\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n          [Hon. Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Omar S. Zaki on brief pro se.\r\n   Robert L. Hamer, Robert B. Gibbons, Mirick, O'Connell,\r\nDeMallie &amp; Lougee, LLP, Joseph F. Ryan, Lyne, Woodworth &amp; Evarts\r\nLLP, Philip M. Howe and Lecomte, Emanuelson, Montejunas &amp; Doyle on\r\nbrief for appellees.\r\n\nOctober 6, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.    By order of November 4, 1998, we\r\npostponed the processing of this appeal from a post-judgment\r\ncharging order to avoid the possibility of piecemeal review. \r\nAppellees have informed us that all of the district court\r\nmotions by and against the reach and apply defendant, Anne L.\r\nZaki, have been withdrawn.  The district court proceedings now\r\nhave concluded, and no appeal has been taken by Anne L. Zaki. \r\n          Reviewing the arguments relating to appellant Omar S.\r\nZaki's interests in the light of the slim record thus properly\r\nbefore us, the order is affirmed.  Below, appellant did not\r\nsquarely present in a timely fashion the arguments about his\r\nown interests which he seeks to raise here, but merely denied\r\nhaving an interest in the partnership.  His arguments about the\r\nrights and prerogatives of the IRS and Anne L. Zaki also are\r\nnot properly before us. \r\n          Accordingly, insofar as the charging order determines\r\nappellees' rights against appellant Omar S. Zaki and any\r\ninterest which appellant Zaki may have in the limited\r\npartnership, the judgment is affirmed.\r\n",
