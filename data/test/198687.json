William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   John Houlihan on brief pro se.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, Robert L. Peabody,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Nina Goodman, Attorney, Department of\r\nJustice, Washington, D.C., on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 21, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Petitioner John Houlihan, having been\r\nsentenced to multiple life terms for offenses arising out of\r\nhis operation of a ruthless drug organization based in\r\nCharlestown, Massachusetts, see United States v. Houlihan, 92\r\nF.3d 1271 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1118 (1997),\r\nappeals from the denial of his motion for relief under 28\r\nU.S.C.  2255.  Of the various claims presented, the district\r\ncourt granted a certificate of appealability (COA) as to one,\r\nand this court later did the same as to a second.  With respect\r\nto those two claims, we now affirm; with respect to the\r\nremaining claims, we deny the pending request for a COA.\r\n          Our earlier decision having set forth the factual and\r\nprocedural background at length, we proceed directly to the\r\nmerits.  The district court certified for appeal a claim of\r\nineffective assistance on the part of appellate counsel--\r\nspecifically, the charge that a challenge should have been\r\nlodged to the ruling that Sargent's statements to the police\r\nwere inadmissible against codefendant Fitzgerald.  We find no\r\nbasis for concluding that \"counsel's performance was deficient\"\r\nin this regard.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687\r\n(1984).  Indeed, to the extent petitioner is alleging that\r\ncounsel should have contested the court's application of the\r\n\"clear and convincing evidence\" standard--a burden of proof\r\nlater deemed overly exacting, see Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1280--\r\nhis argument borders on the frivolous.  Petitioner had proposed\r\nsuch a standard below, for obvious reasons.  See United States\r\nv. Houlihan, 887 F. Supp. 352, 360 (D. Mass. 1995).  Reversing\r\ncourse on appeal not only would have been procedurally\r\nproblematic but, more important, would have undercut his\r\ncentral thesis that the statements should not have been\r\nadmitted against him.  Alternatively, petitioner appears to be\r\ncontending that the court's ruling was vulnerable to attack\r\nbecause the evidence of Fitzgerald's involvement in Sargent's\r\nmurder was so substantial.  Yet the court's decision was based\r\non the lack of proof that Fitzgerald had been motivated by a\r\ndesire to silence Sargent, not on any lack of proof that he had\r\nbeen involved.  In any event, even if counsel's performance\r\ncould be deemed unreasonable, no prejudice would arise given\r\nthe \"extensive evidence\" that petitioner helped to orchestrate\r\nSargent's murder.  Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1293 n.22; see also\r\nHoulihan, 887 F. Supp. at 362-64.\r\n          The issue certified by this court involves the two\r\noutstanding convictions under the murder-for-hire statute, 18\r\nU.S.C.  1958.  Petitioner contends that the district court\r\nlacked jurisdiction over those charges because the evidence\r\nfailed to establish the requisite interstate nexus--i.e., that\r\nhe had \"used\" a \"facility in interstate commerce.\"  The sole\r\npertinent evidence, petitioner asserts, consisted of various\r\ntelephone calls from one point in Massachusetts to another. \r\nSee Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1292-93 (describing such evidence). \r\nRelying on United States v. Weathers, 169 F.3d 336, 339-43 (6th\r\nCir.), cert. denied, 1999 WL 350587 (Oct. 4, 1999), and cases\r\ncited therein, he insists that intrastate telephone calls fail\r\nto trigger the statute, with the result that no criminal\r\noffense was committed in this regard.\r\n          This claim has been procedurally defaulted.  As\r\npetitioner effectively acknowledges, the issue could have been\r\nraised on direct appeal.  Accordingly, whether or not the claim\r\nis properly deemed \"jurisdictional\" in nature, petitioner must\r\nsatisfy the cause-and-prejudice test.  See, e.g., Suveges v.\r\nUnited States, 7 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1993).  He has made only\r\na perfunctory effort to do so.  Although a related claim of\r\nineffective assistance of counsel was included in his  2255\r\npetition, it was later abandoned; petitioner made no mention\r\nthereof in his  2255 memorandum, in his motion for\r\nreconsideration, or in his brief on appeal, and the references\r\nthereto in his reply brief and supplemental memorandum come too\r\nlate.  \r\n          Instead, petitioner invokes the \"actual innocence\"\r\nexception.  See, e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 495-96\r\n(1986).  This exception, which is \"quite narrow and seldom\r\nused,\" Simpson v. Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 210 (1st Cir. 1999),\r\nrequires a showing of \"factual innocence, not mere legal\r\ninsufficiency,\" Bousley v. United States, 118 S. Ct. 1604, 1611\r\n(1998).  At best, petitioner has made only a conditional such\r\nshowing--one that is contingent upon his prevailing on the\r\nmerits of his underlying  1958 claim.  That is likely not\r\nenough.  Yet we need not resolve the matter, since petitioner's\r\neffort fails for a separate reason.  The \"actual innocence\" or\r\n\"miscarriage of justice\" exception is a matter of \"equitable\r\ndiscretion,\" Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 404 (1993),\r\nwhich is invoked only in the \"extraordinary case\" where a\r\npetitioner is \"truly deserving\" of relief from a \"fundamentally\r\nunjust incarceration.\"  Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 320-21\r\n(1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This is not such a\r\ncase.  Even if petitioner succeeded in overturning his  1958\r\nconvictions, he would still be faced with four other life terms\r\n(on counts 1, 2, 8 &amp; 19).  Under these circumstances, it cannot\r\nbe said that his continued incarceration involves anything\r\napproaching a miscarriage of justice. \r\n          Petitioner's remaining claims, as to which a COA is\r\nsought, require little comment; in each instance, we conclude\r\nthat petitioner has failed to make \"a substantial showing of\r\nthe denial of a constitutional right.\"  28 U.S.C.  2253(c)(2). \r\nFirst, in connection with the Sargent murder, petitioner faults\r\ncounsel for failing to pursue exculpatory evidence and failing\r\nto exploit opportunities to discredit a government witness\r\n(Michael Nelson).  Even in the unlikely event that counsel was\r\nsomehow deficient in this regard, no prejudice would have\r\nensued.  As petitioner acknowledges, other evidence was adduced\r\nto the same effect (suggesting, contrary to Nelson's testimony,\r\nthat Nelson rather than codefendant Nardone was the trigger\r\nman).  More important, given the extensive evidence that\r\nSargent's murder was undertaken at petitioner's behest and that\r\nNardone and Nelson jointly participated therein, which of the\r\nlatter two actually pulled the trigger is of little moment\r\nhere.  Furthermore, Nelson's testimony concerning this murder\r\nwas \"corroborated by a number of other witnesses.\"  Houlihan,\r\n887 F. Supp. at 362 n.19.\r\n          Second, petitioner complains about counsel's failure\r\nto challenge the sentence imposed on the CCE charge (count 19). \r\nThis argument overlooks the grouping rules that were invoked at\r\nsentencing.  See May 23, 1995 Tr. at 29-30.  The district court\r\nproperly applied U.S.S.G.  3D1.2, 3D1.4 and 5G1.2(b) to\r\narrive at a life sentence.  \r\n          Third, it is alleged that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to establish, for purposes of the CCE conviction,\r\nthat petitioner was an organizer or supervisor of five or more\r\npersons.  Such a claim is not cognizable in a habeas\r\nproceeding.  See, e.g., Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  It appears frivolous in any event.  See\r\nHoulihan, 92 F.3d at 1277 (describing Fitzgerald and petitioner\r\nas \"the two ringleaders\" of \"an elaborate street-level\r\ndistribution network\"); id. at 1282 (noting that Sargent's\r\n\"assessment of [petitioner's] leadership role [was] confirmed\r\nand described in excruciating detail by a galaxy of live\r\nwitnesses\").\r\n          Fourth, invoking United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549\r\n(1995), petitioner asserts that the \"violent crimes in aid of\r\nracketeering\" statute, 18 U.S.C.  1959 (the subject of counts\r\n7 &amp; 9) is facially invalid under the Commerce Clause.  The same\r\nargument was recently rejected in United States v. Torres, 129\r\nF.3d 710, 717 (2d Cir. 1997).  Petitioner provides no reason to\r\nquestion that court's analysis, and we rely thereon.\r\n          Finally, petitioner has abandoned a claim pertaining\r\nto the logistics of the sentencing process.  In its stead, he \r\nadvances, for the first time on appeal, a challenge to the\r\ngovernment's use of testimony given by witnesses in exchange\r\nfor proffered leniency.  That contention comes too late and is\r\nin any event meritless.  See, e.g., United States v. Lara, 181\r\nF.3d 183, 197-98 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\n          As to the two certified claims, the judgment is\r\naffirmed.  As to the remaining claims, the application for a\r\ncertificate of appealability is denied.\n",

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195690\"><a href=\"/opinion/195690/knight-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span>\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1st Cir. 1994).  It appears frivolous in any event.  See\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Houlihan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1277</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(describing Fitzgerald and petitioner\r\nas \"the two ringleaders\" of \"an elaborate street-level\r\ndistribution network\"); </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1282 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(noting that Sargent's\r\n\"assessment of [petitioner's] leadership role [was] confirmed\r\nand described in excruciating detail by a galaxy of live\r\nwitnesses\").\r\n          Fourth, invoking United States v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span>\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1995), petitioner asserts that the \"violent crimes in aid of\r\nracketeering\" statute, 18 U.S.C.  1959 (the subject of counts\r\n7 &amp; 9) is facially invalid under the Commerce Clause.  The same\r\nargument was recently rejected in United States v. Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748364\"><a href=\"/opinion/748364/united-states-v-ramon-torres-aka-weechie-jason-roman-john-arias/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 717 (2d Cir. 1997).  Petitioner provides no reason to\r\nquestion that court's analysis, and we rely thereon.\r\n          Finally, petitioner has abandoned a claim pertaining\r\nto the logistics of the sentencing process.  In its stead, he \r\nadvances, for the first time on appeal, a challenge to the\r\ngovernment's use of testimony given by witnesses in exchange\r\nfor proffered leniency.  That contention comes too late and is\r\nin any event meritless.  See, e.g., United States v. Lara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764882\"><a href=\"/opinion/764882/united-states-v-giovanni-lara-appellantno-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197-98 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\n          As to the two certified claims, the judgment is\r\naffirmed.  As to the remaining claims, the application for a\r\ncertificate of appealability is denied.\n</pre>",
