This is an appeal from the final\n\njudgment of the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts, issued on remand following a prior appeal to this Court,\n\ndeclaring that the \"Deficit Loan\" made by BCA1 to Fort Hill Square\n\nAssociates accrued compound interest.        FHS Properties Limited\n\nPartnership contests the award of compound, rather than simple,\n\ninterest. For the reasons discussed below, we agree with the appellant\n\nthat the district court's award of compound interest was in error.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          The facts of this case were thoroughly laid out by this Court\n\nin FHS Properties Ltd. Partnership v. BC Associates, 175 F.3d 81, 82-84\n\n(1st Cir. 1999). Due to the narrow scope of this second appeal, we\n\nneed not rehash the complicated details of the structure and history of\n\nthe real estate development project that is the basis for this suit.\n\nFor our purposes, it is only relevant that BCA and FHS are the managing\n\npartners of two partnerships that developed and now own International\n\nPlace, a two-tower office complex in downtown Boston. The project was\n\nplanned in two phases, one for each tower, with two separate and\n\ndistinct partnerships. In April 1991, BCA paid $5.6 million, from its\n\nown funds, to settle a law suit brought against the first partnership\n\n\n\n1 The appellees are BC Associates (\"BCA-1\"), BC Phase 2 Associates\nLimited Partnership (\"BCA-2\"), and Donald Chiofaro and Theodore Oatis,\nthe general partners of BCA-1 and BCA-2. We will refer to them\ncollectively as BCA.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fby certain limited partners who challenged the financing of the second\n\nphase of the project.\n\n            FHS brought this action to clarify whether BCA's settlement\n\npayment was a partnership expense. The district court concluded that\n\nBCA was entitled to indemnification payments from the partnership in\n\nthe amount of $2.1 million, accruing interest at 6% per annum.\n\nHowever, in FHS Properties, we held that BCA's payment met the\n\nconditions of a \"deficit loan\" under the partnership agreement, which\n\namong other things entitled BCA to interest at a rate of 18% per annum.\n\nSee id. at 86-87.    Accordingly, we reversed the district court's\n\njudgment and remanded for proceedings consistent with our opinion.\n\n            FHS then moved for the district court to enter final judgment\n\nspecifying whether the interest on the deficit loan would be simple or\n\ncompound. The deficit loan provision provides only that such loans\n\n\"shall bear interest at an annual rate which is two percentage points\n\nabove the so-called 'Prime rate' . . . or at 18% per year, whichever is\n\ngreater.\"\n\n            After a brief discussion of Massachusetts law2 relating to\n\nthe availability of compound interest, and without any discussion of\n\nthe facts of the case, the district court concluded that the interest\n\nshould be compounded, \"because compounding is the equitable means of\n\n\n\n2 Section 21 of the Partnership Agreement expressly provided that the\ninterpretation of its terms is governed by Massachusetts law.\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffully compensating a creditor-partner under the Deficit Loan\n\nprovision.\" FHS Props. Ltd. Partnership v. BC Assocs., No. 94-CV-\n\n11346-MEL, slip. op. at 2 (D. Mass. Aug. 26, 1999).\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          The appellant challenges the district court's award of\n\ncompound interest, arguing that under Massachusetts law, a court does\n\nnot have discretion to award compound interest in the absence of an\n\nexpress provision in the contract. The appellee acknowledges this\n\ngeneral rule but contends, however, that there is an equitable\n\nexception that was rightfully invoked in this case where FHS behaved\n\ninequitably.\n\n          Whether Massachusetts law permits a court to fashion an\n\nequitable remedy of compound interest on a contractual debt is a\n\nquestion of law, which is, therefore, subject to de novo review. See\n\nNegrón v. Caleb Brett U.S.A., Inc., 212 F.3d 666, 668 (1st Cir. 2000);\n\nNew England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Baig, 166 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nBecause we conclude that Massachusetts law does not permit the award of\n\ncompound interest in a case such as this, when the partnership\n\nagreement specifies an interest rate per annum, we need not address\n\nwhether the comparative equities of the parties support the district\n\ncourt's exercise of discretion in awarding compound interest.\n\n          In Massachusetts, compound interest is generally disfavored.\n\nSee Ellis v. Sullivan, 134 N.E. 695, 697 (Mass. 1922) (recognizing an\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f\"'ancient unwillingness to allow compound interest'\" (quoting Lewin v.\n\nFolsom, 50 N.E. 523, 524 (Mass. 1898))). As early as 1906, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts decreed that interest is simple,\n\n\"unless there is an express agreement to the contrary.\" Inhabitants of\n\nTisbury v. Vineyard Haven Water Co., 79 N.E. 256, 257 (Mass. 1906); see\n\nalso Coupounas v. Madden, 514 N.E.2d 1316, 1321 (Mass. 1987); Von\n\nHemert v. Porter, 52 Mass. 210, 218 (Mass. 1846); D'Annolfo v.\n\nD'Annolfo Constr. Co., 654 N.E.2d 82, 85 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995).\n\nConsequently, compound interest is only permitted in certain\n\nproceedings in equity or by express statutory or contractual authority.\n\nSee Dunne v. City of Boston, 671 N.E.2d 518, 520 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996);\n\nsee also Shapiro v. Bailen, 199 N.E. 315, 316 (Mass. 1936) (recognizing\n\nexception in equity); Ellis, 134 N.E. at 697 (same).\n\n          It is undisputed that the deficit loan provision in the\n\npartnership agreement does not expressly provide for the compounding of\n\ninterest. Indeed, it provides only that a deficit loan \"shall bear\n\ninterest at an annual rate . . . [of no more than] 18% per year.\"\n\nFurthermore, the overwhelming majority of Massachusetts cases equate an\n\ninterest rate \"per annum,\" whether in a contract or a statute, with\n\nsimple interest. See, e.g., Coupounas, 514 N.E.2d at 1322; De Córdova\n\nv. Weeks, 140 N.E. 269, 269-70 (Mass. 1923); Tisbury, 79 N.E. at 257;\n\nD'Annolfo, 654 N.E.2d at 85.     But see Ellis, 134 N.E. at 696-97\n\n(allowing compound interest at stated rate per annum in equity\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fproceeding where debtor deliberately withheld interest payments).\n\nThus, the designated interest rate of \"18% per year,\" construed in its\n\n\"usual and ordinary sense,\" Hakim v. Massachusetts Insurer's Insolvency\n\nFund, 675 N.E.2d 1161, 1164 (Mass. 1997) (citing Cody v. Connecticut\n\nGen. Life Ins. Co., 439 N.E.2d 234 (Mass. 1982)), unambiguously\n\nindicates that the deficit loan accrues simple interest. The parties\n\nto the partnership agreement would, therefore, reasonably have expected\n\nthe deficit loan provision, as drafted, to call for simple interest.\n\n          We are not moved by the appellee's contention that such a\n\nreading of the provision unfairly penalizes BCA because the loan\n\nrepayment will come, in part, from its own partnership profits. Such\n\nis necessarily, and thus foreseeably, the circumstance with every\n\ndeficit loan by its terms, and the provision could have been drafted\n\naccordingly to provide for compound interest. We enforce the contract\n\nas written, and \"'are not free to revise or change'\" it. Hakim, 675\n\nN.E.2d at 1164 (quoting Continental Cas. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 461\n\nN.E.2d 209 (Mass. 1984)); see also Alison H. v. Byard, 163 F.3d 2, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Gibbs, 773 F.2d 15,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1985)). Thus, as a matter of contract law, the award of\n\ncompound interest was in error.\n\n          Nevertheless, the appellee argues that compound interest was\n\nappropriate in this case because the jury found FHS's conduct to be\n\ninequitable.    To that end, the appellee argues that equitable\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fprinciples governed this case from the beginning, and that this Court\n\nshould look to equity and not contract for just compensation. For\n\nsupport, the appellee directs the Court to its Answer, its submissions\n\nof special verdict questions for the jury, and the language of the\n\ndistrict court's Memorandum and Decision to award compound interest.\n\n          After a thorough review of the record and briefs, we cannot\n\nagree. BCA's position throughout the trial was that the $5.6 million\n\nsettlement payment qualified as a deficit loan under the terms of the\n\npartnership agreement. Only as an afterthought, once the case had been\n\nsubmitted to the jury, did BCA raise the issue of compound interest as\n\na matter of equity.\n\n          Furthermore, we are not convinced that the district court\n\nreached the decision that interest should be compounded as a matter of\n\nequity. To be sure, the district court used the word \"equitable\" in\n\nits conclusion.   However, there is no subsequent analysis of the\n\nequities of the case to support the appellee's contention that the\n\naward of compound interest was based on FHS's misconduct. Absent a\n\ndiscussion of the equities, the more plausible reading of the opinion\n\nis that the court was interpreting and applying the terms of the\n\ndeficit loan provision.\n\n          In any event, accounting for \"equitable considerations\" does\n\nnot convert a contract action to one in equity.     We have not been\n\npresented with any authority establishing that the district court had\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthe discretion to depart from the terms of the contract based on\n\nequitable considerations. The majority of cases on which the appellee\n\nrelies for the proposition that a court has discretion to award\n\ncompound interest involve proceedings in equity. See Chokel v. First\n\nNat'l Supermarkets, Inc., 660 N.E.2d 644, 652 (Mass. 1996) (appraisal);\n\nSarrouf v. New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., 492 N.E.2d 1122,\n\n1129 (Mass. 1986) (appraisal); Shapiro, 199 N.E. at 122 (bill in equity\n\nto restrain foreclosure); Ellis, 134 N.E. at 63 (accounting). We are\n\naware of only two compound interest cases that originate in the\n\nenforcement of contracts, Buckley & Scott Utilities v. Petroleum Heat\n\n& Power Co., 48 N.E.2d 154 (Mass 1943), and Howes v. Warren, 73 N.E.2d\n\n834 (Mass. 1947). In neither case, however, was the district court\n\ncalled upon to interpret and apply a provision of a contract, and they\n\nare, therefore, inapplicable.\n\n          Buckley involved an exclusive franchise agreement, but the\n\naction itself was deemed an action in equity to recover damages. See\n\nBuckley, 48 N.E.2d at 156.      The trial court concluded that the\n\ndefendant violated its obligations under the franchise agreement and\n\nproceeded to assess the value of the damages. The Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt of Massachusetts affirmed the award of compound interest on the\n\njudgment dating back to the date of the writ, in part relying on a\n\nMassachusetts statute, G.L. ch. 235, § 8, that set the conditions for\n\ncomputing interest on a judgment. See id. at 160. Thus, the award and\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\finterest was set by the court and did not originate in the terms of the\n\ncontract, as it does in this case.\n\n            In Howes, a contractor sued to recover for labor and\n\nmaterials expended in the alteration and repair of the defendant's\n\nhouse. See Howes, 73 N.E.2d at 834.       The defendant challenged an\n\nauditor's assessment of the fair value of the contractor's work.\n\nAlthough the trial court agreed with the defendant that the auditor's\n\nassessment was unjustified, the court revalued the contractor's work\n\nbased on the auditor's subsidiary findings and awarded judgment for the\n\nplaintiff plus interest compounded as of the date of the filing of the\n\nwrit. See id. at 835. Relying on Buckley, the Supreme Judicial Court\n\naffirmed the order for compound interest paid on the court's judgment\n\nto the plaintiff. Again, the court's issuance of a one-time award plus\n\ninterest stands in sharp contrast to the enforcement of the deficit\n\nloan provision and its stipulated interest rate.\n\n            In summary, whether the district court was accounting for\n\nequitable considerations or was interpreting the terms of the deficit\n\nloan provision, it erred as a matter of law in awarding compound\n\ninterest.\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n            Because there is no authority to depart from the general rule\n\nthat compound interest shall not be allowed unless expressly stated in\n\nthe agreement, and because it is undisputed that the partnership\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fagreement does not provide for compound interest, we conclude that the\n\naward of compound interest in this case was improper. The district\n\ncourt's judgment is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.    Costs against the appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

Due to the narrow scope of this second appeal, we need not rehash the complicated details of the structure and history of the real estate development project that is the basis for this suit. For our purposes, it is only relevant that BCA and FHS are the managing partners of two partnerships that developed and now own International Place, a two-tower office complex in downtown Boston. The project was planned in two phases, one for each tower, with two separate and distinct partnerships. In April 1991, BCA paid $5.6 million, from its own funds, to settle a law suit brought against the first partnership by certain limited partners who challenged the financing of the second phase of the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FHS brought this action to clarify whether BCA's settlement payment was a partnership expense. The district court concluded that BCA was entitled to indemnification payments from the partnership in the amount of $2.1 million, accruing interest at 6% per annum. However, in FHS Properties, we held that BCA's payment met the conditions of a \"deficit loan\" under the partnership agreement, which among other things entitled BCA to interest at a rate of 18% per annum. See id. at 86-87.

As early as 1906, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts decreed that interest is simple, \"unless there is an express agreement to the contrary.\" Inhabitants of Tisbury v.

We are aware of only two compound interest cases that originate in the enforcement of contracts, Buckley &amp; Scott Utilities v. Petroleum Heat &amp; Power Co., 48 N.E.2d 154 (Mass 1943), and Howes v. Warren, 73 N.E.2d 834 (Mass. 1947). In neither case, however, was the district court called upon to interpret and apply a provision of a contract, and they are, therefore, inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buckley involved an exclusive franchise agreement, but the action itself was deemed an action in equity to recover damages. See Buckley, 48 N.E.2d at 156. The trial court concluded that the defendant violated its obligations under the franchise agreement and proceeded to assess the value of the damages. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed the award of compound interest on the judgment dating back to the date of the writ, in part relying on a Massachusetts statute, G.L. ch. 235, &#167;&#167; 8, that set the conditions for computing interest on a judgment. See id. at 160. Thus, the award and interest was set by the court and did not originate in the terms of the contract, as it does in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Howes, a contractor sued to recover for labor and materials expended in the alteration and repair of the defendant's house. See Howes, 73 N.E.2d at 834. The defendant challenged an auditor's assessment of the fair value of the contractor's work. Although the trial court agreed with the defendant that the auditor's assessment was unjustified, the court revalued the contractor's work based on the auditor's subsidiary findings and awarded judgment for the plaintiff plus interest compounded as of the date of the filing of the writ. See id. at 835. Relying on Buckley, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the order for compound interest paid on the court's judgment to the plaintiff. Again, the court's issuance of a one-time award plus interest stands in sharp contrast to the enforcement of the deficit loan provision and its stipulated interest rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, whether the district court was accounting for equitable considerations or was interpreting the terms of the deficit loan provision, it erred as a matter of law in awarding compound interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there is no authority to depart from the general rule that compound interest shall not be allowed unless expressly stated in the agreement, and because it is undisputed that the partnership agreement does not provide for compound interest, we conclude that the award of compound interest in this case was improper.

FHS Properties Limited Partnership contests the award of compound, rather than simple, interest. For the reasons discussed below, we agree with the appellant that the district court's award of compound interest was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case were thoroughly laid out by this Court in FHS Properties Ltd. Partnership v. BC Associates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198448\"><a href=\"/opinion/198448/fhs-v-bc/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 82-84 (1st Cir. 1999). Due to the narrow scope of this second appeal, we need not rehash the complicated details of the structure and history of the real estate development project that is the basis for this suit. For our purposes, it is only relevant that BCA and FHS are the managing partners of two partnerships that developed and now own International Place, a two-tower office complex in downtown Boston. The project was planned in two phases, one for each tower, with two separate and distinct partnerships. In April 1991, BCA paid $5.6 million, from its own funds, to settle a law suit brought against the first partnership by certain limited partners who challenged the financing of the second phase of the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FHS brought this action to clarify whether BCA's settlement payment was a partnership expense. The district court concluded that BCA was entitled to indemnification payments from the partnership in the amount of $2.1 million, accruing interest at 6% per annum. However, in FHS Properties, we held that BCA's payment met the conditions of a \"deficit loan\" under the partnership agreement, which among other things entitled BCA to interest at a rate of 18% per annum. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198448\"><a href=\"/opinion/198448/fhs-v-bc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 86-87. </a></span>Accordingly, we reversed the district court's judgment and remanded for proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FHS then moved for the district court to enter final judgment specifying whether the interest on the deficit loan would be simple or compound. The deficit loan provision provides only that such loans \"shall bear interest at an annual rate which is two percentage points above the so-called 'Prime rate' . . . or at 18% per year, whichever is greater.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a brief discussion of Massachusetts law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> relating to the availability of compound interest, and without any discussion of the facts of the case, the district court concluded that the interest should be compounded, \"because compounding is the equitable means of fully compensating a creditor-partner under the Deficit Loan provision.\" FHS Props. Ltd. Partnership v. BC Assocs., No. 94-CV-11346-MEL, slip. op. at 2 (D. Mass. Aug. 26, 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant challenges the district court's award of compound interest, arguing that under Massachusetts law, a court does not have discretion to award compound interest in the absence of an express provision in the contract. The appellee acknowledges this general rule but contends, however, that there is an equitable exception that was rightfully invoked in this case where FHS behaved inequitably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Massachusetts law permits a court to fashion an equitable remedy of compound interest on a contractual debt is a question of law, which is, therefore, subject to de novo review. See Negroon v. Caleb Brett U.S.A., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198945\"><a href=\"/opinion/198945/negron-v-caleb-brett-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span>, 668 (1st Cir. 2000); New England Mut.

Because we conclude that Massachusetts law does not permit the award of compound interest in a case such as this, when the partnership agreement specifies an interest rate per annum, we need not address whether the comparative equities of the parties support the district court's exercise of discretion in awarding compound interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Massachusetts, compound interest is generally disfavored.

In neither case, however, was the district court called upon to interpret and apply a provision of a contract, and they are, therefore, inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buckley involved an exclusive franchise agreement, but the action itself was deemed an action in equity to recover damages. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Buckley,</span> <span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">156</span></span>. The trial court concluded that the defendant violated its obligations under the franchise agreement and proceeded to assess the value of the damages. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed the award of compound interest on the judgment dating back to the date of the writ, in part relying on a Massachusetts statute, G.L. ch. 235, &#167;&#167; 8, that set the conditions for computing interest on a judgment. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 160. </span>Thus, the award and interest was set by the court and did not originate in the terms of the contract, as it does in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Howes, a contractor sued to recover for labor and materials expended in the alteration and repair of the defendant's house. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Howes,</span> <span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">834</span></span>. The defendant challenged an auditor's assessment of the fair value of the contractor's work. Although the trial court agreed with the defendant that the auditor's assessment was unjustified, the court revalued the contractor's work based on the auditor's subsidiary findings and awarded judgment for the plaintiff plus interest compounded as of the date of the filing of the writ. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 835. </span>Relying on Buckley, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the order for compound interest paid on the court's judgment to the plaintiff. Again, the court's issuance of a one-time award plus interest stands in sharp contrast to the enforcement of the deficit loan provision and its stipulated interest rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, whether the district court was accounting for equitable considerations or was interpreting the terms of the deficit loan provision, it erred as a matter of law in awarding compound interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there is no authority to depart from the general rule that compound interest shall not be allowed unless expressly stated in the agreement, and because it is undisputed that the partnership agreement does not provide for compound interest, we conclude that the award of compound interest in this case was improper. The district court's judgment is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
