Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\n\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert B. Mann, by appointment of the court, with whom Mann\n& Mitchell was on brief for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and James H.\nLeavey, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\n\n                          May 2, 2000\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.                In March 1999, a federal grand\n\njury    indicted       Peter     A.    Filippi     on   charges       of    operating    a\n\nracketeering enterprise and racketeering conspiracy, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§     1962(c),    (d)       (1994),        and    related      charges       concerning\n\nextortionate credit and illegal gambling.                            Id. §§ 892, 894,\n\n1955.     Filippi then filed a motion asking that he be declared\n\nincompetent to stand trial because he suffered from vascular\n\ndementia and was unable to assist his counsel.                         After a limited\n\nexamination, the government's psychiatrist agreed.                           Thereafter,\n\nin January 2000, the district court found that Filippi was not\n\ncompetent to stand trial and should be committed to a federal\n\nfacility for evaluation for a period not to exceed four months\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d).\n\n            Section 4241(d)--the centerpiece of this case--provides\n\ninter alia that where the district court finds a defendant\n\nincompetent       to    stand     trial     by    reason   of    mental      disease    or\n\ndefect, the court \"shall\" commit the defendant to the custody of\n\nthe    Attorney        General,       who   is    required      to    hospitalize      the\n\ndefendant for treatment and \"for such a reasonable period of\n\ntime, not to exceed four months, as is necessary to determine\n\nwhether    there        is   a    substantial        probability           that   in   the\n\nforeseeable future [the defendant] will attain the capacity to\n\n                                            -2-\n\fpermit the trial to proceed.\"             Id.    Another provision, not here\n\npertinent,    governs     where    the     initial       examination       does   not\n\nestablish such a \"substantial probability.\"                    See id. § 4246.\n\n           Although the finding of incompetency was to Filippi's\n\nliking, the commitment order was not.                  He objected on the ground\n\nthat the medical evidence showed that he suffered from vascular\n\ndementia, that the condition is irreversible, and that therefore\n\nconfinement     for    purposes    of    diagnosis        served     no   legitimate\n\npurpose   and    thus    violated        the    Due     Process      Clause.      The\n\ngovernment      does    not    concede    that     Filippi      is    irreversibly\n\nincompetent, but the district court made no finding on the\n\npoint.    Instead, the court concluded that where a defendant was\n\nfound incompetent to stand trial, Congress had provided for\n\nautomatic hospitalization for a limited period to permit an\n\ninpatient diagnosis, and it rejected Filippi's constitutional\n\nattack on the statute.\n\n           Filippi      then    filed     a     notice    of   appeal      from   the\n\ncommitment    order     and    sought     a     stay    successively       from   the\n\ndistrict court and from this court.                   Like the district court,\n\nthis court denied the stay, but we expedited this appeal.                         The\n\ngovernment asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction over the\n\nappeal and says that in any event the statute and the commitment\n\norder do not violate the Constitution.                  We find that we do have\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fjurisdiction     but   agree      with    the    government    as    to     the\n\nconstitutionality of the statute and order.\n\n         On the question of jurisdiction, Filippi concedes that\n\nthe commitment order is not a \"final decision\" resolving this\n\ncase within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994), which\n\nconfers on us    \"jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions\n\nof the district courts\"; and none of the statutory provisions\n\nexplicitly allowing for interlocutory appeals applies here.\n\nSee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3731.        However, Filippi asserts that the\n\norder incarcerating him for up to four months is reviewable\n\nunder the collateral-order doctrine, see Cohen v. Beneficial\n\nIndus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949), and its progeny.\n\n         In     this   circuit,    such   a     collateral   order   must    be\n\ndistinct from the merits, definitive as to the issue to be\n\nreviewed, affect       interests that could not be vindicated by\n\nappeal after a final judgment, and present a significant legal\n\nissue (as opposed, for example, to the mere challenge to the\n\nexercise of discretion).       United States v. Kouri-Perez, 187 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).      The government concedes that the first\n\nand third requirements are satisfied but says that the second\n\nand fourth requirements have not been met.\n\n         On the first of these two disputed issues--whether the\n\nruling to be reviewed is definitive--the government is right in\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fsaying that Filippi's competency to stand trial has not yet been\n\nfinally determined (since he is even now being examined) but\n\nwrong in thinking that this matters.           The requirement of a\n\ndefinitive ruling is meant to avoid premature review of an\n\nundeveloped issue.    Here, the order that Filippi is challenging\n\nis his initial commitment, which is now occurring; and the\n\nconstitutional issue he seeks to present was addressed and\n\nexpressly decided by the district court.\n\n          As for the significance of the legal issue, it is true\n\nthat the two circuits that have addressed the constitutional\n\nissue both agreed with the government and upheld the statute.\n\nBut the issue is an open one in this circuit, its importance is\n\nobvious both for this case and many others, and we think the\n\nconstitutional attack is not frivolous even though we ultimately\n\nreject it and believe it reasonably clear that the Supreme Court\n\nwould do likewise.     Thus, there is enough significance to the\n\nissue to warrant review under the collateral-order doctrine.\n\n          Turning to the merits, we assume          arguendo that the\n\nstatute means exactly what it says, namely, that the district\n\ncourt has no discretion in the matter and must commit the\n\ndefendant for an initial period of up to four months after\n\nfinding   him   incompetent   to   stand   trial.    This   may   be   an\n\noverstatement--suppose, for example, the defendant was close to\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdeath.   But no such extraordinary claim has been pressed in this\n\ncase and, whatever the possible implicit exceptions, the statute\n\ncertainly establishes a general rule of some breadth and does\n\nnot appear to call for any case-by-case choice by the district\n\ncourt as to whether to incarcerate once the incompetency finding\n\nhas been made.\n\n           It is the use of a general rule that gives Filippi's\n\nconstitutional argument such force as it may possess.                          Filippi\n\nhas not yet been found guilty of a crime and is not being\n\ndetained as a flight risk or danger to the community; nor is\n\nthere    any    suggestion        that    his     mental      condition    makes    him\n\ndangerous to himself or to others.                 There is not even a finding,\n\nalthough       possibly    one     could    be     made,      that   an   in-hospital\n\nexamination is necessary for government experts to make a more\n\ncareful determination whether Filippi is afflicted with vascular\n\ndementia   or     to     elicit    evidence       as     to   whether     there    is   a\n\n\"substantial probability\" that he will soon recover sufficient\n\ncapacity to stand trial.\n\n           The     Due    Process        Clause    has    been   taken    to   protect\n\ncertain \"fundamental rights\" from unreasonable impairment, even\n\nwhere there is no challenge to the fairness of the procedures\n\nused, Washington v. Glucksberg, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 2267 (1997),\n\nand among such rights an individual's interest in his \"liberty\"\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fis surely at the top of the list.             United States v. Salerno, 481\n\nU.S. 739, 750 (1987).            Filippi's liberty is certainly being\n\nimpaired   by    the    order,    but    clearly    the    government      has    a\n\ncompelling interest in pursuing the diagnosis; Filippi, after\n\nall, has been indicted by a grand jury for serious crimes but\n\nnow claims that he cannot be tried and punished because his\n\nmental condition makes him unable to assist his counsel.\n\n           The   constitutional         question    is     whether    automatic\n\ncommitment with substantial safeguards as to duration is a\n\nreasonable, and sufficiently \"narrowly tailored,\" accommodation\n\nof the competing interests.         See Glucksberg, 117 S. Ct. at 2268.\n\nIn our view, Congress could reasonably think that, in almost all\n\ncases, temporary incarceration would permit a more careful and\n\naccurate diagnosis before the court is faced with the serious\n\ndecision whether to defer trial indefinitely and (quite often)\n\nto   release     the    defendant       back     into     society.         Is    it\n\nunconstitutional for Congress to make a uniform rule rather than\n\nto have a determination made on a case-by-case basis?\n\n           For    two    reasons,       one    practical     and     the    other\n\nprecedential, we think the statute is constitutional.                      On the\n\npractical side, the statute is categorical in determining who\n\nshall be incarcerated, but it is much more flexible and case-\n\noriented   in    determining      the    length    of    incarceration.          In\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\faddition to the cap on the initial diagnosis limiting it to a\n\nmaximum of four months, the statute provides that the period of\n\nincarceration is only for \"such a reasonable period of time . .\n\n. as is necessary\" to determine whether the defendant will\n\nattain the capacity for trial in the foreseeable future.                  Here,\n\nthe district judge ordered reports at 30-day intervals, and the\n\nrecord reflects the expectation that the detention will not last\n\nthe entire four months.\n\n           The second consideration is precedential. Although the\n\nSupreme Court has not squarely decided the issue before us, it\n\ndid face in Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972), the general\n\nissue of committing those found incompetent to stand trial.\n\nWhile it rejected indefinite commitment, it upheld in principle\n\ncommitment   for    a    \"reasonable      period   of    time      necessary   to\n\ndetermine whether there is a substantial probability that [the\n\ndefendant]   will       attain     that     capacity    in   the    foreseeable\n\nfuture.\"     Id. at 738.         The present statute is self-evidently\n\nbuilt upon Jackson, Congress having concluded that four months\n\nfell within the concept of a \"reasonable period\".                   See S. Rep.\n\nNo. 98-225, at 236 (1984), reprinted in 1984             U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182,\n\n3418.\n\n           Since its enactment, two other circuits have ruled that\n\nsection 4241(d) conforms to Jackson.                   See United States v.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fDonofrio, 896 F.2d 1301, 1302-03 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 497\n\nU.S. 1005 (1990); United States v. Shawar, 865 F.2d 856, 863-64\n\n(7th Cir. 1989).   Nor do we agree with Filippi that the law has\n\nbeen changed in any way helpful to him by Kansas v. Hendricks,\n\n521 U.S. 346 (1997).     That case upheld a commitment statute\n\ndirected to sexual predators based on a finding of dangerousness\n\ncoupled with mental illness; but it did not, as Filippi would\n\nhave it, hold that dangerousness is always a condition        of\n\ncommitment.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

Filippi on charges of operating a racketeering enterprise and racketeering conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1962(c), (d) (1994), and related charges concerning extortionate credit and illegal gambling. Id. &#167;&#167; 892, 894, 1955. Filippi then filed a motion asking that he be declared incompetent to stand trial because he suffered from vascular dementia and was unable to assist his counsel. After a limited examination, the government's psychiatrist agreed. Thereafter, in January 2000, the district court found that Filippi was not competent to stand trial and should be committed to a federal facility for evaluation for a period not to exceed four months pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4241(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4241(d)--the centerpiece of this case--provides inter alia that where the district court finds a defendant incompetent to stand trial by reason of mental disease or defect, the court \"shall\" commit the defendant to the custody of the Attorney General, who is required to hospitalize the defendant for treatment and \"for such a reasonable period of time, not to exceed four months, as is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future [the defendant] will attain the capacity to permit the trial to proceed.\" Id.

He objected on the ground that the medical evidence showed that he suffered from vascular dementia, that the condition is irreversible, and that therefore confinement for purposes of diagnosis served no legitimate purpose and thus violated the Due Process Clause. The government does not concede that Filippi is irreversibly incompetent, but the district court made no finding on the point. Instead, the court concluded that where a defendant was found incompetent to stand trial, Congress had provided for automatic hospitalization for a limited period to permit an inpatient diagnosis, and it rejected Filippi's constitutional attack on the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Filippi then filed a notice of appeal from the commitment order and sought a stay successively from the district court and from this court. Like the district court, this court denied the stay, but we expedited this appeal. The government asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal and says that in any event the statute and the commitment order do not violate the Constitution. We find that we do have jurisdiction but agree with the government as to the constitutionality of the statute and order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the question of jurisdiction, Filippi concedes that the commitment order is not a \"final decision\" resolving this case within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (1994), which confers on us \"jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\"; and none of the statutory provisions explicitly allowing for interlocutory appeals applies here. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731. However, Filippi asserts that the order incarcerating him for up to four months is reviewable under the collateral-order doctrine, see Cohen v. Beneficial Indus.

There is not even a finding, although possibly one could be made, that an in-hospital examination is necessary for government experts to make a more careful determination whether Filippi is afflicted with vascular dementia or to elicit evidence as to whether there is a \"substantial probability\" that he will soon recover sufficient capacity to stand trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause has been taken to protect certain \"fundamental rights\" from unreasonable impairment, even where there is no challenge to the fairness of the procedures used, Washington v.

Filippi's liberty is certainly being impaired by the order, but clearly the government has a compelling interest in pursuing the diagnosis; Filippi, after all, has been indicted by a grand jury for serious crimes but now claims that he cannot be tried and punished because his mental condition makes him unable to assist his counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional question is whether automatic commitment with substantial safeguards as to duration is a reasonable, and sufficiently \"narrowly tailored,\" accommodation of the competing interests.

On the practical side, the statute is categorical in determining who shall be incarcerated, but it is much more flexible and case-oriented in determining the length of incarceration. In addition to the cap on the initial diagnosis limiting it to a maximum of four months, the statute provides that the period of incarceration is only for \"such a reasonable period of time... as is necessary\" to determine whether the defendant will attain the capacity for trial in the foreseeable future. Here, the district judge ordered reports at 30-day intervals, and the record reflects the expectation that the detention will not last the entire four months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second consideration is precedential. Although the Supreme Court has not squarely decided the issue before us, it did face in Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972), the general issue of committing those found incompetent to stand trial. While it rejected indefinite commitment, it upheld in principle commitment for a \"reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that [the defendant] will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future.\" Id. at 738. The present statute is self-evidently built upon Jackson, Congress having concluded that four months fell within the concept of a \"reasonable period\". See S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 236 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3418.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since its enactment, two other circuits have ruled that section 4241(d) conforms to Jackson.

Curran, United States Attorney, and James H. Leavey, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Boudin, Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boudin, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, a federal grand jury indicted Peter A. Filippi on charges of operating a racketeering enterprise and racketeering conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1962(c), (d) (1994), and related charges concerning extortionate credit and illegal gambling. Id. &#167;&#167; 892, 894, 1955. Filippi then filed a motion asking that he be declared incompetent to stand trial because he suffered from vascular dementia and was unable to assist his counsel. After a limited examination, the government's psychiatrist agreed. Thereafter, in January 2000, the district court found that Filippi was not competent to stand trial and should be committed to a federal facility for evaluation for a period not to exceed four months pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4241(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4241(d)--the centerpiece of this case--provides inter alia that where the district court finds a defendant incompetent to stand trial by reason of mental disease or defect, the court \"shall\" commit the defendant to the custody of the Attorney General, who is required to hospitalize the defendant for treatment and \"for such a reasonable period of time, not to exceed four months, as is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future [the defendant] will attain the capacity to permit the trial to proceed.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Another provision, </span>not here pertinent, governs where the initial examination does not establish such a \"substantial probability.\" See id. &#167; 4246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the finding of incompetency was to Filippi's liking, the commitment order was not. He objected on the ground that the medical evidence showed that he suffered from vascular dementia, that the condition is irreversible, and that therefore confinement for purposes of diagnosis served no legitimate purpose and thus violated the Due Process Clause. The government does not concede that Filippi is irreversibly incompetent, but the district court made no finding on the point. Instead, the court concluded that where a defendant was found incompetent to stand trial, Congress had provided for automatic hospitalization for a limited period to permit an inpatient diagnosis, and it rejected Filippi's constitutional attack on the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Filippi then filed a notice of appeal from the commitment order and sought a stay successively from the district court and from this court. Like the district court, this court denied the stay, but we expedited this appeal. The government asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal and says that in any event the statute and the commitment order do not violate the Constitution. We find that we do have jurisdiction but agree with the government as to the constitutionality of the statute and order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the question of jurisdiction, Filippi concedes that the commitment order is not a \"final decision\" resolving this case within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (1994), which confers on us \"jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\"; and none of the statutory provisions explicitly allowing for interlocutory appeals applies here. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731. However, Filippi asserts that the order incarcerating him for up to four months is reviewable under the collateral-order doctrine, see Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span> </a></span>(1949), and its progeny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit, such a collateral order must be distinct from the merits, definitive as to the issue to be reviewed, affect interests that could not be vindicated by appeal after a final judgment, and present a significant legal issue (as opposed, for example, to the mere challenge to the exercise of discretion). United States v. Kouri-Perez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198454\"><a href=\"/opinion/198454/united-states-v-kouri-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1999). The government concedes that the first and third requirements are satisfied but says that the second and fourth requirements have not been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first of these two disputed issues--whether the ruling to be reviewed is definitive--the government is right in saying that Filippi's competency to stand trial has not yet been finally determined (since he is even now being examined) but wrong in thinking that this matters. The requirement of a definitive ruling is meant to avoid premature review of an undeveloped issue. Here, the order that Filippi is challenging is his initial commitment, which is now occurring; and the constitutional issue he seeks to present was addressed and expressly decided by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the significance of the legal issue, it is true that the two circuits that have addressed the constitutional issue both agreed with the government and upheld the statute. But the issue is an open one in this circuit, its importance is obvious both for this case and many others, and we think the constitutional attack is not frivolous even though we ultimately reject it and believe it reasonably clear that the Supreme Court would do likewise. Thus, there is enough significance to the issue to warrant review under the collateral-order doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, we assume arguendo that the statute means exactly what it says, namely, that the district court has no discretion in the matter and must commit the defendant for an initial period of up to four months after finding him incompetent to stand trial. This may be an overstatement--suppose, for example, the defendant was close to death. But no such extraordinary claim has been pressed in this case and, whatever the possible implicit exceptions, the statute certainly establishes a general rule of some breadth and does not appear to call for any case-by-case choice by the district court as to whether to incarcerate once the incompetency finding has been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the use of a general rule that gives Filippi's constitutional argument such force as it may possess. Filippi has not yet been found guilty of a crime and is not being detained as a flight risk or danger to the community; nor is there any suggestion that his mental condition makes him dangerous to himself or to others. There is not even a finding, although possibly one could be made, that an in-hospital examination is necessary for government experts to make a more careful determination whether Filippi is afflicted with vascular dementia or to elicit evidence as to whether there is a \"substantial probability\" that he will soon recover sufficient capacity to stand trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause has been taken to protect certain \"fundamental rights\" from unreasonable impairment, even where there is no challenge to the fairness of the procedures used, Washington v. Glucksberg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2258</span></a></span>, 2267 (1997), and among such rights an individual's interest in his \"liberty\" is surely at the top of the list. United States v. Salerno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 750 (1987). Filippi's liberty is certainly being impaired by the order, but clearly the government has a compelling interest in pursuing the diagnosis; Filippi, after all, has been indicted by a grand jury for serious crimes but now claims that he cannot be tried and punished because his mental condition makes him unable to assist his counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional question is whether automatic commitment with substantial safeguards as to duration is a reasonable, and sufficiently \"narrowly tailored,\" accommodation of the competing interests. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Glucksberg,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
