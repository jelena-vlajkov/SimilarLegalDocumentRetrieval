After carefully reviewing the briefs\n\nand record on appeal, we affirm the Commissioner’s decision.\n\nThe record contained substantial evidence that the appellant\n\nsuffered no severe, nonexertional impairment of twelve-\n\nmonths duration.        The ability to engage in repetitive wrist\n\nmotion is normally an exertional capacity.                   The appellant\n\ndid    not   develop    any   argument    that    her       need    to    avoid\n\nrepetitive     wrist     motion    operated      as     a    nonexertional\n\nimpairment in her case.            20 C.F.R. 404.1569a; Rodriguez\n\nPagan v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 819 F.2d 1,\n\n2 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n             Although    manual    dexterity     is     a    nonexertional\n\ncapacity required for sedentary work, the record contained\n\nexplicit medical findings of adequate manipulative skills.\n\nThe March 1995 medical report stated, inter alia, that the\n\nappellant     could    handle    common   objects     and     lift       medium\n\nweights, and the March 1992 report stated that she had full\n\nrange of motion in her left hand.                Moreover, the record\n\ncontained no evidence that the appellant had any severe,\n\nmanual impairment that persisted for at least twelve months.\n\n20 C.F.R. § 404.1509.           The record shows that her symptoms\n\nwere   initially      sporadic    in   the   first    year     of    alleged\n\ndisability, she sought no treatment for the next three\n\fyears, and her ability to handle common objects was reported\n\nto be normal at the end of the disability period.
