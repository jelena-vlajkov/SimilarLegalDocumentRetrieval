GALLUCCI, a/k/a Michael Gallucci,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n         [Hon. Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     James A. Currier and Hodosh, Spinella & Angelone on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Lauren E. Jones, David L. Krech and Jones Associates on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        July 14, 2000\n\f         Per     Curiam.          Plaintiff-appellant        Trustmark\n\nInsurance Co. appeals from the district court’s denial of\n\nits motion for a writ of execution that included prejudgment\n\ninterest pursuant to R.I.Gen.Laws § 9-21-10. Trustmark’s\n\nbrief contains only one developed argument: that under the\n\ngoverning Rhode Island statute, an award of prejudgment\n\ninterest is mandatory.      As to its failure to raise the issue\n\nin a timely manner following entry of judgment, Trustmark\n\nalludes to two arguments.\n\n         Trustmark’s       main    argument    is   that    the   second\n\njudgment entered in this case on February 9, 1998, denying\n\ndefendant’s    postjudgment       motions,    rendered     its    earlier\n\nrequest for prejudgment interest (in its motion for writ of\n\nexecution) timely.    The second judgment did not modify the\n\nfirst judgment in any way, but merely formalized the denial\n\nof defendant’s postjudgment motions.           Moreover, the motion\n\nseeking prejudgment interest was filed before entry of the\n\nsecond judgment.     Under these circumstances, the second\n\njudgment had no effect on the timeliness of Trustmark’s\n\nmotion. See McNabola v. Chicago Transit Authority, 10 F.3d\n\n501, 521 (7th Cir. 1993).\n\n         Trustmark suggests that the court erred in failing\n\nto grant relief pursuant to Rule 60.           While Rule 60(a) has\n\fsometimes been used to correct an omission of mandatory\n\nprejudgment    interest,      those      cases     are    factually\n\ndistinguishable from this one.       Here, the computation of the\n\namount of prejudgment interest to which Trustmark would be\n\nentitled   under   the   statute   was   not   “simple,   clear   and\n\nmechanical.” Compare Aubin v. Fudala, 782 F.2d 287, 289 (1st\n\nCir. 1986)(applying Rule 60(a) to request for prejudgment\n\ninterest pursuant to a New Hampshire statute).            Here, the\n\noriginal judgment made no mention of prejudgment interest.\n\nAnd the parties disagree about the date that the cause of\n\naction accrued under the statute. Compare Pogor v. Makita\n\nU.S.A., Inc., 135 F.3d 384, 388 (6th Cir. 1998); Kosnoski v.\n\nHowley, 33 F.3d 376, 379 (4th Cir. 1994); McNickle v. Bankers\n\nLife and Cas. Co., 888 F.2d 678, 682 (10th Cir. 1989).            The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in failing to\n\ngrant the requested relief under Rule 60(a).        See Paddington\n\nPartners v. Bouchard, 34 F.3d 1132, 1141 (2d Cir. 1994).\n\n           Any other possible grounds for appellate relief\n\nhave been waived by Trustmark’s failure to include developed\n\narguments in its brief.     See Airport Impact Relief, Inc. v.\n\nWykle, 192 F.3d 197, 205 (1st Cir. 1999) (“Issues adverted to\n\nin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fdeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived for purposes of\n\nappeal”).\n\n            The district court’s Order Affirming Magistrate\n\nJudge’s   Denial   of   Motion   for   Writ   of   Execution,   dated\n\nJanuary 15, 1999, is affirmed.         See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
