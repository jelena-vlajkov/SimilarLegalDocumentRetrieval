GARIB-BAZAIN,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Charles E. Fitzwilliam, Gonzalez & Torres P.S.C., Howard M.\nSrebnick and Black, Srebnick & Kornspan on memorandum for\nappellant.\n\n\n\n\n                        August 30, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam.         This is an interlocutory criminal\n\nappeal from a district court order denying a motion to\n\ndismiss on statute-of-limitations grounds.                 Because it is\n\n\"well settled law\" that such an order \"is not immediately\n\nappealable under the collateral order doctrine,\" United\n\nStates v. Pi, 174 F.3d 745, 750 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 120\n\nS.   Ct.   74   (1999),    we   dismiss    the    appeal     for   lack    of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n            In connection with his employment at a medical\n\ninstitute in Puerto Rico, defendant Dr. Jorge Garib Bazain\n\nwas indicted on two counts: conspiracy to commit program\n\nfraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 666, and perjury, 18 U.S.C. § 1623.\n\nPrior to trial, he moved to dismiss the conspiracy count as\n\ntime-barred     under     the   applicable       five-year    statute      of\n\nlimitations.     See 18 U.S.C. § 3282.       When the district court\n\ndenied that motion, defendant filed the instant appeal.                    As\n\nhe recognizes, such an order is immediately appealable only\n\nif   it    satisfies    the     three    criteria    that     define      the\n\ncollateral-order exception: the order \"must (1) conclusively\n\ndetermine the disputed question, (2) resolve an important\n\nissue completely separate from the merits of the action, and\n\n(3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fjudgment.\"         Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S.\n\n794, 799 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              Defendant contends that, just as denials of motions\n\nto       dismiss    on    double-jeopardy            grounds    satisfy   these\n\ncriteria, see Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651 (1977),\n\nso do denials of motions to dismiss on limitations grounds.\n\nWith      respect    to    the   third     criterion      in    particular,    he\n\nasserts      that    a    \"right    not    to   be    tried,\"    like   the   one\n\nrecognized in Abney, is also involved here--a right that\n\n\"would be irretrievably lost if review were postponed until\n\ntrial is completed.\"               Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S.\n\n259, 266 (1984).           Such a right is said to derive from the\n\nlanguage of § 3282 (\"no person shall be ... tried\")1 and from\n\nthe degree to which statutes of limitations and the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause overlap in purpose.\n\n              This view runs into a wall of contrary authority.\n\nAs defendant acknowledges, the four circuit courts to have\n\naddressed the issue are in agreement that the denial of a\n\nlimitations defense is not immediately appealable.                            See,\n\n\n     1    18 U.S.C. § 3282 provides:\n\n          Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, no\n     person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any\n     offense, not capital, unless the indictment is found\n     or the information is instituted within five years\n     next after such offense shall have been committed.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fe.g., United States v. Weiss, 7 F.3d 1088, 1089-90 (2d Cir.\n\n1993); United States v. Rossman, 940 F.2d 535, 536 (9th Cir.\n\n1991) (per curiam); United States v. Davis, 873 F.2d 900,\n\n908-09 (6th Cir. 1989) (cited in Pi, 174 F.3d at 750); United\n\nStates v. Levine, 658 F.2d 113, 116-29 (3d Cir. 1981).                    And\n\nthe    Supreme     Court   has    held   that    denials   of   motions    to\n\ndismiss      on    speedy-trial      grounds      are   not     immediately\n\nappealable.        See United States v. MacDonald, 435 U.S. 850\n\n(1978).\n\n             With rare exceptions, an interlocutory order in a\n\nfederal criminal case rejecting or deferring a decision on\n\na defense to prosecution is reviewable on appeal only if and\n\nafter the defendant is convicted and sentenced.                     This is\n\nwell settled practice in the federal courts and is based\n\nupon obvious practical considerations.              In a few situations,\n\nsuch    as   double   jeopardy,      special     reasons   exist    for   an\n\nexception     to    this    general      rule,    but   the     statute   of\n\nlimitations is an ordinary defense and it can fully and\n\nfairly be vindicated by appeal after a final judgment.\n\n             The reasoning of these four circuit courts, which\n\ndefendant     has    not   called    into   serious     question,    proves\n\nentirely persuasive.             For the reasons set forth by those\n\ncourts at greater length, we conclude that the denial of a\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f motion to dismiss on statute-of-limitations grounds is not\n\n immediately appealable under the collateral-order doctrine.2\n\n\n\n           Dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n    2    We note that, during the pendency of this appeal,\ndefendant has gone to trial, been convicted and sentenced, and\nfiled a separate notice of appeal from final judgment.     Our\ndismissal of the instant appeal has no bearing on that second\nappeal. Defendant is of course free to raise the limitations\nissue therein.\n\n                             -5-\n\f",
