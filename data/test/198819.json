In   these   consolidated\n\ncriminal appeals, Todd Arsenault, Stephen Balsam, John Meuse,\n\nThomas Meuse and Joseph Zackular seek to set aside their respective\n\nconvictions, and in certain instances the sentences imposed by the\n\ndistrict court, in connection with a rash of armed robberies\n\nperpetrated in the Boston area during 1990. We affirm the district\n\ncourt judgment in all respects.\n\n                                    I\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          While employed as an electrician at BayBank in Lynn,\n\nMassachusetts in 1989, Thomas Meuse stole the bank’s blueprints.\n\nLater, he recruited his friend James Ferguson, a convicted armed\n\nrobber, as well as several other accomplices, to rob the bank.\n\nMeuse planned to cut a hole in the roof at night, through which\n\nFerguson could gain access.     Once inside, Ferguson was to wait\n\nuntil bank employees arrived for work the following morning,\n\nthreaten them with a gun, then force them to open the vaults.\n\n          On January 7, 1990, Meuse and Ferguson, along with other\n\naccomplices, committed the BayBank robbery as planned and made away\n\nwith approximately $125,000.        Over the next eleven months, the\n\ngroup robbed fourteen other banks and business establishments in\n\nthe Boston area.1\n\n     1\n      These were: Somerset Savings Bank (2/90); a Stoneham jewelry\nstore (3/90); Malden Trust Company (3/90); Warren Five Cents\nSavings Bank (4/90); Woburn BayBank (5/90); Lynn BayBank (5/90);\n\n                                    3\n\f           Thomas Meuse participated in almost all the robberies\n\nwhich took place prior to his arrest in August 1990.                     James\n\nFerguson   participated   in    all    the    robberies.      The   remaining\n\nappellants — John Meuse (Thomas Meuse’s brother), Todd Arsenault,\n\nStephen Balsam, and Joseph Zackular — joined the conspiracy later.2\n\n           Thomas Meuse was indicted in December 1994 on a single\n\ncount of aiding and abetting an armed bank robbery.            See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2113(a), (d); id. § 2(a).           Over the next six months, four\n\nsuperseding   indictments      issued,    adding    various    charges    and\n\ncodefendants.3 Following further discovery and extensive pretrial-\n\nmotion practice, the forty-eight-day trial began in March 1997.\n\n           James   Ferguson,     a    prime    government     witness    whose\n\ntestimony spanned eight days, described the criminal activities of\n\n\n\n\nMalden BayBank (5/90); East Boston Savings Bank (6/90); Depositors’\nTrust Company (7/90); Lloyd’s Diamond & Gold (8/90); Gallahue’s\nMarket (9/90); Everett Cooperative Bank (9/90); Woburn BayBank\n(10/90); and Capital Bank & Trust (11/90).\n     2\n      John Meuse joined in March 1990, Arsenault in May 1990,\nBalsam in August 1990.     Zackular’s involvement developed more\ngradually: Ferguson used proceeds from the January 1990 robbery to\nbuy a car from a dealership owned by Zackular.      Over the next\nseveral months, the two became friends.      Eventually, Ferguson\nconfided in Zackular that the money used to buy the car had been\nstolen. At that time, Zackular advised Ferguson how to set up a\nsham business to conceal the source of the stolen funds.\nEventually, Zackular asked if he could participate in the last two\nrobberies, which occurred during October and November 1990.\n     3\n      The additional charges included: conspiracy to commit armed\nbank robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 371; armed bank robbery, id. § 2113;\nusing a firearm in a crime of violence, id. § 924(c)(1); and\nconspiring to affect commerce by means of robbery, id. § 1951.\n\n                                      4\n\fhis codefendants in lurid detail.         Notwithstanding the extensive\n\ncross-examination of Ferguson by defense counsel, guilty verdicts\n\nwere returned against each defendant on multiple counts.4\n\n                                    II\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\nA.    The Speedy Trial Act Claim\n\n           Thomas Meuse claims that the trial was delayed for more\n\nthan seventy nonexcludable days in violation of the Speedy Trial\n\nAct (STA).     See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1).         There was no reversible\n\nerror.5\n\n           On May 5, 1995, Thomas Meuse and the government submitted\n\na joint motion to continue the hearing on Meuse’s various pretrial\n\nmotions. The motion stipulated that the \"[t]he government [was] in\n\nthe process of providing defense counsel with 79 transcripts of\n\nrecorded conversations as well as other discovery materials,\" and\n\nthat \"[o]nce that process is complete, the parties will be in a\n\nbetter position to agree on certain [discovery-related] matters and\n\nto   conduct   a   meaningful   hearing   before    the   Court.\"   Through\n\n\n\n      4\n      Thomas Meuse was sentenced to 627 months; John Meuse 336;\nZackular 262; Balsam 204; Arsenault 60.     Balsam, Zackular and\nArsenault were directed to pay restitution as well.\n      5\n      Normally, we would review factual findings relating to the\nSTA for clear error only, and legal rulings de novo. See United\nStates v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 1997). But\nsince the district court denied Thomas Meuse’s STA motion without\nfactual findings, we undertake plenary review. See United States\nv. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                     5\n\fcounsel, Meuse expressly agreed that the requested continuance\n\nwould “serve the ends of justice and that such action outweighs the\n\nbest interests of the public and the defendants in a speedy trial.\"\n\nAlthough it allowed the continuance, the district court did not\n\nsimultaneously      reschedule   the   hearing   date.     Ultimately,     the\n\nhearing took place on January 22, 1996 — 206 days after the fourth\n\nsuperseding indictment had been filed.\n\n              The STA states that \"interest of justice\" continuances\n\nare to be excluded in computing the maximum seventy-day STA time\n\nperiod.      See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(A).6       Based on our decision in\n\nUnited States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1998), Meuse\n\ncontends that open-ended continuances under section 3161(h)(8)(A)\n\nshould be strongly disfavored.         Barnes is readily distinguishable,\n\nhowever. There the district court had ordered a continuance on its\n\nown   motion,     without   defense    counsel’s    consent   and   with   no\n\n\n      6\n          The STA states in pertinent part:\n\n      The following periods of delay shall be excluded in\n      computing the time within which an information or an\n      indictment must be filed, or in computing the time within\n      which the trial of any such offense must commence:\n           . . . .\n           Any period of delay resulting from a continuance\n           granted by any judge on his own motion or at the\n           request of the defendant or his counsel or at the\n           request of the attorney for the Government, if the\n           judge granted such continuance on the basis of his\n           findings that the ends of justice served by taking\n           such action outweigh the best interest of the\n           public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(A).\n\n                                       6\n\fexplanation as to how the continuance would serve the interests of\n\njustice. By contrast, Meuse consented to this continuance, and the\n\njoint motion itself explained the grounds for the delay.        See id.\n\nat 13 (noting that the court need not articulate its explanation\n\nfor a continuance where the reasons are apparent, i.e., \"set forth\n\nin the motion papers\").     Furthermore, the open-ended continuance\n\nwas granted because the parties suggested no date certain for\n\nrescheduling the hearing. See United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497,\n\n508 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"[I]n some cases . . .       a court is forced to\n\norder an (h)(8) continuance without knowing exactly how long the\n\nreasons supporting the continuance will remain valid.\").\n\n          Meuse further contends that his former counsel rendered\n\nineffective assistance by endorsing the continuance.       Meuse states\n\nthat he told his attorney at the outset to accept no continuance\n\nbecause Meuse believed that the government had not yet gathered\n\nsufficient evidence to convict.        Although we normally decline to\n\naddress ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal, see United\n\nStates v. Ademaj, 170 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 1999), the present\n\nrecord is sufficiently developed to enable us to do so.\n\n          In   order   to   demonstrate    ineffective   assistance,   a\n\ndefendant must prove that defense counsel’s decision was (1) so\n\ndeficient that it did not come within the \"wide range of reasonable\n\nprofessional assistance,\" and (2) actually prejudiced the defense.\n\nUnited States v. Ortiz, 146 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing\n\n\n                                   7\n\fStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984)).\n\n\n\n\n                               8\n\f          Notwithstanding      the    conclusory        assertion    that   the\n\ngovernment lacked the evidence to convict, the record discloses\n\nthat on May 5, 1995 the government and the defense were engaged in\n\nexchanging voluminous discovery materials — including dozens of\n\ntranscripts of incriminating tape-recorded conversations — in a\n\nhighly   complex    criminal   case       potentially    involving    multiple\n\ndefendants.   Moreover, after Meuse dismissed his first attorney,\n\nreplacement counsel vigorously proceeded with various pretrial and\n\ndiscovery motions.      Based on the sheer volume of the discovery\n\nmaterials disclosed by the government, Meuse’s attorneys would have\n\nrendered less than effective assistance had they insisted on\n\nproceeding to trial precipitously, without adequate opportunity to\n\nreview the strengths and weaknesses of the government’s evidence.\n\n           Furthermore, the present record does not demonstrate that\n\nthe 206-day delay prejudiced the Thomas Meuse defense.                 For one\n\nthing, the defense relied heavily on the taped conversations to\n\nimpeach Ferguson, the prime prosecution witness.            See, e.g., infra\n\nSection II.H.7     There was no STA violation.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      The attempt to attribute the entire 206-day delay to former\ndefense counsel’s consent is an exaggeration as well. On July 3,\n1995, Meuse’s brother, John, filed his own pretrial motions. Since\nThomas and John were to be tried jointly, John’s motions would have\ntolled Thomas’s STA period for the \"reasonable period of delay\"\nrequired to dispose of John’s motions \"promptly.\" See 18 U.S.C. §\n3161(h)(7) & (h)(1). Thomas Meuse has not attempted to demonstrate\nthat the delay from July 1995 to January 1996 for hearing and\nresolving John Meuse’s motions was not “reasonable.”\n\n                                      9\n\fB.   The Sealing of the Fourth Superseding Indictment\n\n          Thomas Meuse and Todd Arsenault contend that it was\n\nimproper to seal the fourth superseding indictment filed in June\n\n1995 since the government did not disclose the reasons for doing\n\nso, and further, that the government chose to seal the indictment\n\nin order to gather additional evidence against the defendants, not\n\nbecause it needed more time to arrest defendants.    Finally, they\n\nurge dismissal on the ground that only a properly sealed indictment\n\ntolls the statute of limitations and the limitations period had\n\nelapsed before the court unsealed the fourth superseding indictment\n\nin February 1996.8\n\n          Criminal Rule 6(e)(4) provides:\n\n          The federal magistrate judge to whom an\n          indictment is returned may direct that the\n          indictment be kept secret until the defendant\n          is in custody or has been released pending\n          trial.   Thereupon the clerk shall seal the\n          indictment and no person shall disclose the\n          return of the indictment except when necessary\n          for the issuance and execution of a warrant or\n          summons.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(4).     Rule 6(e) rests on the premise that\n\ncriminal defendants not yet in custody may elude arrest upon\n\nlearning of their indictment.    Once the court sealed the fourth\n\nsuperseding indictment in this case, arrest warrants were issued\n\nagainst Arsenault, Balsam and Zackular, who had not yet been taken\n\n\n     8\n      We review de novo the district court ruling rejecting the\nmotion to dismiss the indictment. See United States v. Stokes, 124\nF.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                10\n\finto custody on the federal charges.          Contrary to appellants’\n\ncontention,   moreover,   the   government   need   not   articulate   its\n\nreasons for requesting that an indictment be sealed, so long as its\n\nrequest is based on a ground set forth in Rule 6(e). See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. LaLiberte, 131 F.R.D. 20, 20-21 (D. Mass. 1990);\n\nUnited States v. Maroun, 699 F. Supp. 5, 6-7 (D. Mass 1988).\n\n          Their further assertion — that the government utilized\n\nthe sealing procedure as a ruse — is meritless.      Rule 6(e) does not\n\n\"forbid the sealing of an indictment for any reason other than\n\ntaking a defendant into custody . . . [but] a magistrate may grant\n\nthe government’s request . . . ‘for any legitimate prosecutorial\n\nobjective or where the public interest otherwise requires it.’\"\n\nUnited States v. Richard, 943 F.2d 115, 118 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(citation omitted).   In the present case, the government needed to\n\ntake steps to place cooperating defendant Ferguson in a witness\n\nprotection program during the summer of 1995.       The protection of a\n\nkey prosecution witness undoubtedly qualifies as a legitimate\n\nprosecutorial objective. See id. at 119 (citing with approval\n\nUnited States v. Ramey, 791 F.2d 317, 318 (4th Cir. 1986)).\n\n          Nevertheless, appellants contend that the government\n\nshould have returned to court to inform the magistrate judge of its\n\nnew objective.   Appellants cite no authority for their contention,\n\nhowever, and the authority we have found is to the contrary.           See\n\nid. (finding \"no authority for the implied proposition that the\n\n\n                                   11\n\fgovernment must return to the magistrate as each new reason for\n\ncontinuing the sealing order arises\").      Finally, appellants point\n\nto no evidence that the ensuing seven-month delay was either\n\npretextual or unreasonable.9\n\n          We   therefore   affirm    the   refusal   to   dismiss   the\n\nindictment.\n\nC.   The Courtroom Seating Arrangements\n\n          Citing the small courtroom and the attendant security\n\nconcerns, the district court directed that the defendants be seated\n\nin the front row of the spectator section, rather than beside their\n\nrespective counsel at the defense table.       John Meuse claims that\n\nthe mandated seating arrangement prevented or restrained defendants\n\nfrom exercising their Sixth Amendment right to communicate with\n\ncounsel at trial.    Further, he argues that these arrangements\n\nimproperly undercut the presumption of innocence, as the jury may\n\nhave inferred from the isolated grouping of the defendants that\n\nthey must be conconspirators, as charged, and because the court\n\nsecurity officers rose to their feet each time defendants got up to\n\nconsult with counsel, thus perhaps intimating to the jury that\n\ndefendants posed a security risk.          Finally, Meuse faults the\n\n\n\n     9\n      Although we need not opine on the matter at this time, we\nnote that the government’s decision to seal an indictment in order\nto gather further evidence against a defendant has been held to\nconstitute a legitimate prosecutorial objective under Rule 6(e).\nSee Richard, 943 F.2d at 119 (citing United States v. Lakin, 875\nF.2d 168, 170 (8th Cir. 1989)).\n\n                                12\n\fdistrict court for failing even to consider the alternative seating\n\narrangement proposed by the defendants, which would have moved the\n\ndefense counsel table forward two or three feet, thereby enabling\n\nthe   defendants     to    be   seated     in   a   row   directly     behind      their\n\nrespective counsel.\n\n           As courtroom seating arrangements \"depend[] upon such a\n\nvariety of factors, e.g., the size of the courtroom, the number of\n\nspectators,    the   number        of   defendants    and      lawyers,    acoustics,\n\nsecurity provisions, etc.,\" we will not disturb the trial court\n\ndecision for anything less than \"a clearcut abuse of discretion.\"\n\nUnited States v. Turkette, 656 F.2d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 1981); cf.\n\nUnited States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting\n\nthat, in light of courtroom security concerns, appellate court\n\nnormally   defers    to     reasonable      conditions      for    admitting       trial\n\nspectators).    Appellants have not met their burden.\n\n           First,     the       district    court     ruled     that   its    seating\n\narrangement was necessary due to the limited space available in the\n\nsmall courtroom, and by the obvious security concerns which might\n\narise if ten people were to be seated at or behind the defense\n\ntable.     Under     the    district       court    plan,      moreover,     the    five\n\ndefendants were seated only four to five feet from the defense\n\ntable, in the front row of the spectator section.                  The trial judge\n\nalso assured the defendants that they could consult freely with\n\ntheir attorneys      as     they    wished,     either    by    walking    the     short\n\n\n                                           13\n\fdistance to the defense table, or passing written notes.                           See\n\nUnited States v. Sorrentino, 726 F.2d 876, 887 (1st Cir. 1984)\n\n(finding that arrangement caused no hindrance in communications).\n\nThus,   in   practical    terms      the    seating   arrangement       imposed     no\n\nsignificant impediment upon defendants’ Sixth Amendment right to\n\nconsult with trial counsel.\n\n             Nor is it apparent that defendants sustained any other\n\nsignificant    or   unwarranted       prejudice.      The    front      row   in   the\n\nspectator section is not an inherently prejudicial location for\n\nseating criminal       defendants.          See Turkette,        656   F.2d   at   10.\n\nFurthermore, it is by no means clear that seating the defendants as\n\na group directly behind the defense table, as they proposed, would\n\nhave lessened any slim chance that the jury would draw an improper\n\ninference of guilt by association.                 Moreover, their proposal\n\npresented logistical problems, as it required that ten persons be\n\nseated in a cramped area, which would block one of the gates in the\n\nbar rail and require that all witnesses be rerouted through the\n\nremaining gate.\n\n             Finally, their characterization of the court security\n\nofficers’     movements    —    as    \"defensive\"      —    is    subjective       and\n\nconclusory.      The record in no way suggests that the security\n\nofficers’    actions     were   either      so   dramatic   or     unusual    as    to\n\ninfluence the jury       unduly.\n\n             We therefore discern no clearcut abuse of discretion in\n\n\n                                           14\n\fthe district court ruling.    See id. at 10.10\n\nD.   The Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Thomas   Meuse   claims    that   the   government   adduced\n\ninsufficient evidence that he knew Ferguson would use a gun during\n\ntheir armed robbery of the Somerset Savings Bank on February 10,\n\n1990, and that this court must therefore reverse his conviction for\n\naiding and abetting Ferguson in the use of a firearm during that\n\nrobbery.   See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).        More particularly, Meuse\n\nargues that although he and Ferguson did discuss the need to use a\n\nfirearm for the Lynn BayBank robbery in January 1990, they did not\n\ndo so in regard to the Somerset Savings Bank robbery, in which a\n\nsignificantly different modus operandi was employed.\n\n           In order to convict Meuse of aiding and abetting, it was\n\nnecessary for the government to prove that he knew to a \"practical\n\ncertainty,\" United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir.\n\n1995), that Ferguson would use a gun in the Somerset Savings Bank\n\nrobbery.   The government did so.11\n\n           First, Meuse exaggerates the dissimilarities in the modi\n\n\n     10\n      There is no conclusive evidence that the district court\ndeclined to consider the alternative seating arrangement.\nMoreover, the defense motion was filed before the district court\nruled. Finally, defendants never suggested below that the court\nhad overlooked their motion.\n     11\n      Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nverdict, we assess its sufficiency de novo to determine whether a\nrational jury could find each element of the charged offense beyond\na reasonable doubt. See United States v. Guerrero, 114 F.3d 332,\n339 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                 15\n\foperandi employed in the two robberies.        He planned and instigated\n\nthese robberies because he had worked inside both banks, as an\n\nelectrician, and was familiar with their layouts and security\n\nsystems.    In discussions with Ferguson prior to the first robbery,\n\nMeuse proposed to bypass the security systems by cutting through\n\nthe bank’s roof.     He suggested that Ferguson be lowered into the\n\nbank to await the early arrival of bank employees, whom Ferguson\n\nwas to threaten with a weapon in order to gain access to the\n\nvaults. Afterward, Ferguson was to flee in a getaway car manned by\n\nMeuse and their accomplices.       The same essential elements were\n\nutilized in the first two robberies, as well as in several later\n\nrobberies.    Although Ferguson did not testify that he and Meuse\n\nagain spoke about using a gun immediately prior to the second\n\nrobbery, the very absence of any such discussion on the second\n\noccasion fairly invited a rational jury inference that the second\n\nbank robbery was to be conducted in essentially the same manner,\n\nincluding    the   intimidation   of    bank   employees   with   a   gun,\n\nsuccessfully employed in the first robbery.\n\n            There was other evidence as well from which the jury\n\nrationally could find that Meuse himself carried the gun to the\n\nsecond bank robbery.    Ferguson testified that, following the first\n\nrobbery, he gave Meuse the gym bag which contained not only\n\nFerguson’s 9mm semiautomatic pistol but also the tools Meuse had\n\nused to cut a hole in the Lynn BayBank roof.         Meuse took the bag\n\n\n                                   16\n\fhome with him; then, as Ferguson testified, Meuse carried it to the\n\nsecond robbery.     Thus, the jury rationally could infer that upon\n\nopening the gym bag to retrieve the cutting tools needed to\n\npenetrate the Somerset Bank roof, Meuse would have seen the gun.\n\nMoreover, Ferguson testified that he used the same weapon in both\n\nrobberies.\n\n          Therefore, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, see Guerrero, 114 F.3d at 339, the evidence supported a\n\nrational inference that Meuse knew to a “practical certainty” that\n\nFerguson would use a gun in the second robbery.\n\nE.   The Guilty Plea Colloquy\n\n          Thomas Meuse next contends that the district court erred\n\nin admitting into evidence the state-court plea colloquy which took\n\nplace at the time he pled guilty to charges arising out of his\n\nabortive August 1990 robbery of Lloyd’s Diamond & Gold. Citing Old\n\nChief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997), Meuse contends that\n\nhis agreement to stipulate to this earlier guilty plea barred the\n\ngovernment from adducing any further evidence about either the\n\nprior conviction or the underlying robbery.\n\n             Evidentiary rulings under Federal Rule of Evidence 403\n\nare reviewed only for abuse of discretion.     See United States v.\n\nTse, 135 F.3d 200, 208 (1st Cir. 1998).     In his state-court plea\n\ncolloquy, Meuse admitted that he and Sean Cote had used burglary\n\ntools in an attempt to cut through the Lloyd’s Jewelry Store roof,\n\n\n                                  17\n\fand   when   detected    by   police,   had     fired   on   the   police   while\n\nattempting unsuccessfully to escape in a stolen car.                 Meuse pled\n\nguilty to attempted breaking and entering, assault with a dangerous\n\nweapon, and unlawful possession of an electric weapon (stun gun),\n\nburglary tools, and a stolen vehicle. As this abortive robbery was\n\nalso the subject matter of the Hobbs Act conspiracy count charged\n\nin the federal indictment against Meuse, the plea colloquy clearly\n\nwas admissible as an admission probative of his guilt on the Hobbs\n\nAct count. See United States v. De Leon Ruiz, 47 F.3d 452, 455 (1st\n\nCir. 1995); Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).             Thus, reliance on Old Chief\n\nwas misplaced, since the government in that case had charged the\n\ndefendant with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.                  See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).        The Supreme Court therefore held that the\n\ngovernment must accept the defendant’s offer to stipulate to the\n\nfact of the prior conviction, but could not adduce evidentiary\n\ndetails of the underlying crime.             See Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 177,\n\n190 (\"[T]he fact of the qualifying [prior felony] conviction is\n\nalone what matters under [18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)].\").               However, the\n\nbases for the Supreme Court ruling were (i) that “proof of the\n\ndefendant’s [felon] status goes to an element entirely outside the\n\nnatural sequence of what the defendant is charged with thinking and\n\ndoing   to   commit     the   current    offense     [viz.,    possessing     the\n\nfirearm],” id. at 191, and (ii) that the defendant’s proffered\n\nstipulation was fully adequate to prove his felon status, whereas\n\n\n                                        18\n\fa jury informed   that defendant previously committed a serious\n\nassault might infer that he had a “bad character,” and this\n\nevidence of propensity would cause defendant “unfair prejudice”\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 403, id. at 180-86.\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\f             In contrast, however, \"the prosecutor’s choice [not to\n\naccept a defendant’s stipulation] will generally survive a Rule 403\n\nanalysis when a defendant seeks to force the substitution of an\n\nadmission     for   evidence      creating      a   coherent   narrative   of   his\n\nthoughts and actions in perpetrating the offense for which he is\n\nbeing tried.\"       Id. at 192.    The Meuse plea colloquy plainly fit the\n\nlatter mold, for in it he described conduct specifically charged in\n\nthe federal indictment; i.e., his August 1990 armed robbery.                    We\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion.\n\nF.   The Rule 404(b) Objections\n\n             Joseph    Zackular      and     John    Meuse     challenge   various\n\nevidentiary rulings pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and\n\n404(b).12    These rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion only.\n\nSee United States v. Mangual-Corchado, 139 F.3d 34, 43 n.22 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n             Prior to trial, Zackular submitted a motion in limine\n\nannouncing his intention to cross-examine Ferguson to expose his\n\n\n\n     12\n          Rule 404(b) provides:\n\n             Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is\n             not admissible to prove the character of a\n             person in order to show action in conformity\n             therewith. It may, however, be admissible for\n             other purposes, such as proof of motive,\n             opportunity,   intent,   preparation,   plan,\n             knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or\n             accident . . . .\n\nFed. R. Evid. 404(b).\n\n                                           20\n\fpersonal bias against Zackular; specifically, that following his\n\narrest Ferguson had attempted to have Zackular murdered.                 Citing\n\nFederal   Rule     of   Evidence   403,      Zackular   contended   that    the\n\ngovernment should not be allowed to introduce evidence as to the\n\nbasis   for    Ferguson’s   animus;    i.e.,     that   Ferguson    mistakenly\n\nbelieved that Zackular, who had been under indictment for unrelated\n\nfederal extortion charges in 1990, had implicated Ferguson in the\n\nrobberies which took place in 1990 in order to obtain favorable\n\ntreatment from the government in Zackular’s extortion case.                  In\n\nNovember 1990, Zackular pled guilty to conspiring to transmit\n\nthreats in interstate commerce.        Ferguson was arrested in December\n\n1990.\n\n              Although the district court did not permit the government\n\nto establish that Zackular had been convicted of extortion, the\n\ngovernment was allowed to introduce evidence that a criminal case\n\nwas   pending    against    Zackular    in    1990.     The   district     court\n\ndetermined that the probative value of this limited proof — i.e.,\n\nproviding the jury with the \"complete story\" relating to Ferguson’s\n\nalleged bias — substantially outweighed any danger of unfair\n\nprejudice.\n\n              Contrary to Zackular’s claim, no per se rule bars the\n\ngovernment’s introduction of evidence clearly relevant to a jury’s\n\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fassessment of a government witness’s bias.13 Absent any explanation\n\nfor Ferguson’s animus toward Zackular, the jury might be misled to\n\nconclude that Ferguson’s feelings were irrational or arbitrary.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 530 F.2d 1076, 1079 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1976) (\"[T]he trier [of fact] must be sufficiently informed of\n\nthe   underlying   relationships,    circumstances   and   influences\n\noperating on a witness so that, in light of his experience, he can\n\ndetermine whether a mutation in testimony could reasonably be\n\nexpected as a probable human reaction.\") (citation omitted). Since\n\nthe district court substantially dampened the prejudicial effect of\n\nthe evidence by not allowing the government to demonstrate that\n\nZackular had been convicted of extortion, we cannot conclude that\n\nit abused its discretion in drawing the Rule 403 balance as it did.\n\nSee United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d 796, 800 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (noting that appellate courts rarely disturb a “debatable”\n\nRule 403 determination).14\n\n\n      13\n       The government points out as well that this evidence was\nrelevant for purposes other than witness bias. For example, the\nevidence corroborated the Ferguson testimony that Zackular had\nasked to become directly involved in the final robberies in 1990 in\norder to get money to pay for his defense in the extortion case.\nWe may affirm the district court on any ground apparent from the\nrecord.   See United States v. Awon, 135 F.3d 96, 99 (1st Cir.\n1998).\n      14\n      For the same reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in\nadmitting the evidence that Zackular was required, as a condition\nof his pretrial release on the extortion charges, to call his\npretrial services officer twice a week. This evidence corroborated\nFerguson’s testimony that Zackular had placed such calls from a\ncellular phone, on the mornings of both the Woburn BayBank (10/90)\n\n                                22\n\f              Second,   the   court   did   not   abuse   its   discretion    by\n\nadmitting the testimony of Jeannette Dion that Dion feared her\n\nformer boyfriend, John Meuse. First, the court did not permit Dion\n\nto describe specific \"bad acts\" which might explain the grounds for\n\nher   fear.      Further,     the   Dion   testimony   was   relevant,   as   it\n\nexplained her reluctance to testify as a government witness.                  Any\n\ncountervailing prejudicial effect was slight, as Dion testified\n\nthat she had been fearful of Meuse on but one occasion, and was\n\n\"not afraid of him otherwise.\"             Any error was harmless as well,\n\ngiven the direct evidence of Meuse’s guilt (e.g., the Ferguson\n\ntestimony).      See, e.g., United States v. Harris, 165 F.3d 1062,\n\n1066 (6th Cir. 1999).\n\n              Finally, asked what Meuse had done with the robbery\n\nproceeds, Dion testified that he had bought marijuana.               As Meuse\n\npreserved no objection to this evidence,15 we review for plain error\n\nonly.      See United States v. Conley, 186 F.3d 7, 21 n.15 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (\"Plain errors are ‘those errors so shocking that they\n\nseriously affect the fundamental fairness and basic integrity of\n\nthe proceedings conducted below.’\") (citation omitted).                  Meuse\n\n\n\n\nand Capital Bank & Trust (11/90) robberies.\n      15\n      First, the government asked Dion if she could recall whether\nMeuse had bought any \"illegal substances.\" The defense did not\nobject. When she answered \"Yes,\" the government asked: \"What do\nyou recall?\" At that point, Dion answered: \"marijuana.\" Only\nthen did the defense object. The court sustained the objection,\nbut the defense did not request a limiting instruction.\n\n                                       23\n\fincorrectly asserts that this drug evidence was totally unrelated\n\nto the crimes charged (i.e., armed robbery).         Cf., e.g., United\n\nStates v. Currier, 821 F.2d 52, 56 & n.7 (1st Cir. 1987) (drug sale\n\nunrelated to firearms charge). It was relevant at least insofar as\n\nit demonstrated that Meuse had bought many expensive gifts for Dion\n\nwhile he had no source of legitimate income, which made it somewhat\n\nmore likely that he had used robbery proceeds to do so.          As this\n\nisolated, brief reference to marijuana almost certainly had no\n\nsignificant prejudicial effect on the jury, we find no plain error.\n\nG.   The Juror Misconduct Claim\n\n           Appellants fault the district court for failing to “voir\n\ndire” the jury after counsel to John Meuse reported having observed\n\njurors examining one another’s notes.       Appellants insist that the\n\ntrial judge was duty-bound to investigate these allegations.        See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d 436, 442 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n           As the district courts are better situated to determine\n\nwhether   juror   misconduct   occurred   and   prejudice   resulted,   we\n\nnormally review their remediation measures only for a patent abuse\n\nof discretion.     See United States v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22, 28 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).   \"The trial judge is not . . . shackled to a rigid and\n\nunyielding set [of] rules and procedures that compel any particular\n\nform or scope of inquiry,\" Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d at 443, but\n\nshould be left free to fashion a remedy appropriate and reasonable\n\n\n                                   24\n\fin the circumstances, see id.\n\n             As counsel for John Meuse was the one person in the\n\ncourtroom who reportedly observed the alleged misconduct, the\n\ndistrict court simply instructed the jurors that they were not to\n\nlook at each other’s notes.       Since appellants failed to move for a\n\nmistrial, the remediation measures selected by the district court\n\nare reviewed only for plain error.        See id. at 442.     And since the\n\nmisconduct in question was uncorroborated,16 and did not raise the\n\nsame specter of prejudice as improper outside influences upon the\n\njury, cf. id. at 443 (voir dire conducted where juror allegedly\n\ndiscussed     case   with   daughter,     who   was   seen   speaking   with\n\ndefendant’s girlfriend); cf. also United States v. Bertoli, 40 F.3d\n\n1384, 1394 (3d Cir. 1994), we find no plain error.\n\nH.   Limitations on Cross-examination\n\n             Zackular claims that the district court erred in denying\n\nhim an unrestricted opportunity to play the tape recordings of\n\nFerguson’s jailhouse conversations in an effort to show that\n\nFerguson was biased and lacked credibility.             See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n608(b).17      The proffered tape recordings graphically described\n\n\n     16\n      Several days later, defense counsel claimed to have seen\njurors consulting each other’s notes again. The district court\nexpressly observed, however, that it had been keeping a careful\nwatch, but had seen no impropriety.\n     17\n          Rule 608(b) provides:\n\n             Specific   instances of the conduct of a\n             witness,   for the purpose of attacking or\n\n                                     25\n\fFerguson’s efforts to have Zackular killed.            Since the defense\n\ntheory turned principally upon Ferguson’s personal animus toward,\n\nand motives for falsely implicating, Zackular, it is Zackular’s\n\ncontention that the district court ruling violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confront the witnesses against him.\n\n            Confrontation clause challenges are reviewed de novo to\n\ndetermine   whether    defense    counsel   was   afforded   a    reasonable\n\nopportunity to impeach adverse witnesses; once that threshold is\n\nreached, the trial court’s restrictions on the extent and manner of\n\ncross-examination are reviewed only for abuse of discretion.             See\n\nUnited States v. Gomes, 177 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 1999).                 The\n\nZackular claims fail.\n\n            First,    during     the   cross-examination     of   Ferguson,\n\nZackular’s counsel elicited an admission that Ferguson had tried to\n\nhave   Zackular   killed.      Moreover,    Zackular   played     two   taped\n\nconversations in which Ferguson described his antagonism; for\n\n\n\n            supporting the witness’ credibility, other\n            than conviction of crime as provided in rule\n            609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\n            They may, however, in the discretion of the\n            court, if probative of truthfulness or\n            untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-\n            examination of the witness (1) concerning the\n            witness’   character   for  truthfulness    or\n            untruthfulness,   or    (2)  concerning   the\n            character for truthfulness or untruthfulness\n            of another witness as to which character the\n            witness being cross-examined has testified.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 608(b).\n\n                                       26\n\fexample, Ferguson threatened to \"blow [Zackular’s] head off.\"   As\n\nthe jury was adequately apprised of the nature and vehemence of\n\nFerguson’s feelings toward Zackular, Zackular was afforded an\n\nadequate opportunity to impeach the witness in conformance with the\n\nSixth Amendment right of confrontation.\n\n\n\n\n                                27\n\f            Furthermore, the district court expressly ruled that\n\nZackular would be permitted to play any tape recording which\n\ndisclosed Ferguson’s bias. See id. at 81 (\"[E]xtrinsic evidence is\n\nadmissible to show [witness] bias.\").               Inexplicably, however,\n\nZackular has identified no particular tape excerpt which he was\n\nprecluded from using.        See United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d\n\n1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that appellate court will deem\n\nwaived    \"issues   raised   on   appeal   in   a   perfunctory   manner\").\n\nFinally, the district court correctly held that the recordings\n\ncould not be used to undermine Ferguson’s credibility.            See Gomes,\n\n177 F.3d at 81 (\"Extrinsic evidence of specific bad acts is not\n\nadmissible to show untruthfulness.\").18             There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\nI.   Closing Arguments\n\n            Appellants contend that their convictions must be set\n\naside due to improper closing arguments by the prosecution. First,\n\nthey assert that the prosecutor intimated that defendants had the\n\nburden of proof and that they should have taken the stand.              For\n\n\n\n     18\n      Zackular argues that the contents of the tapes did not\nconstitute \"extrinsic evidence,\" since the recorded statements —\nalbeit out-of-court — were made by Ferguson.    On the contrary,\nextrinsic evidence includes any evidence other than trial\ntestimony. See United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 237\n(1st Cir. 1988) (\"Rule 608(b), which allows specific instances of\nconduct to be ‘inquired into’ on cross-examination to attack\ncredibility, does not provide for the admission of physical\nevidence.\") (emphasis added).       The tapes were just such\nnontestimonial evidence.\n\n                                     28\n\finstance, the prosecutor stated: \"Did you hear any effort made [by\n\nthe defense] . . . to ask [Ferguson] about whether he had ever made\n\nany inconsistent statements [e.g., in his taped conversations]\n\nabout [appellants’ involvement in] these robberies?\"\n\n          Closing arguments are reviewed de novo and reversible\n\nerror will be found only if the arguments were \"‘both inappropriate\n\nand harmful.’\" United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 29 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (citation omitted).          Prosecutorial comments will be\n\nfound harmful if, “in the totality of the circumstances, they would\n\nprobably have affected the outcome of the trial.\"          Id.19\n\n          The prosecution may not comment on a defendant’s failure\n\nto take the witness stand in his own defense.             See Griffin v.\n\nCalifornia, 380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring).\n\nNevertheless,   the   government   \"may     focus   on   the   absence   of\n\nimpeachment [of government witnesses] during cross-examination so\n\nlong as [its] comments are ‘sufficiently circumscribed and [do] not\n\nnecessarily implicate appellant’s assertion of his fifth amendment\n\nright’ not to take the stand in his own defense.\"        United States v.\n\nGoldman, 563 F.2d 501, 505 (1st Cir. 1977) (citation omitted; final\n\nalteration in original); see Hall v. United States, 46 F.3d 855,\n\n\n\n     19\n      Among the relevant factors to be considered are \"the severity\nof the purported misconduct, the weight of the evidence supporting\nthe verdict, the presence and likely effect of a curative\ninstruction, and the prosecutor's purpose in making the statement\n(i.e.: whether the statement was willful or inadvertent).\" Laboy-\nDelgado, 84 F.3d at 29.\n\n                                   29\n\f858 (8th Cir. 1995); cf. United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1338\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (observing that prosecution comments concerning the\n\nplausibility of a defense theory do not shift the burden of proof\n\nto the defense).       Although it is a source of continual amazement to\n\nus that prosecutors would choose “to hand [a] defendant an issue on\n\nwhich to appeal,\" see Goldman, 563 F.2d at 505, these closing\n\narguments — viewed in their totality and context — expressly\n\nfocused only on defects in the cross-examination of Ferguson by the\n\ndefense, without inevitably implying that appellants should have\n\ntaken the stand.20\n\n               Second, appellants complain that the government vouched\n\nfor Ferguson’s credibility.            After observing that Ferguson would\n\nlose the benefits of his plea bargain were he to perjure himself,\n\nthe prosecutor stated: \"[Ferguson would] just throw that away,\n\nknowing that he would have two federal prosecutors, agents, going\n\nout checking everything he is saying, verifying. . . . You have\n\nseen a mountain of records . . . all of this stuff is being checked\n\nand verified, the things that he is saying. . . . Judge Lindsay,\n\nwho has heard all of this [viz., the government’s case] for the\n\nlast three months and particularly James Ferguson for three weeks,\n\nwill    make    that   decision   as    to   what   sentence   to   give   him.\"\n\n\n\n       20\n      Moreover, even if the comments were determined inappropriate,\nthe district court repeatedly instructed the jury that the\ngovernment, not the defendants, bore the burden of proof. See id.;\nsupra note 19.\n\n                                        30\n\f(Emphasis added.)      Appellants argue that these comments suggested\n\nto the jury that the prosecutor or the judge knew of evidence,\n\nnever disclosed to the jury, which would confirm that Ferguson was\n\ntelling the truth.\n\n              As appellants failed to object to the closing remarks, we\n\nreview only for plain error.        See United States v. Smith, 101 F.3d\n\n202, 213 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 769\n\n(1st   Cir.    1996)   (noting    that    a   “plain   error”   is   one   which\n\n\"seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\nthe trial process\").\n\n              \"‘[A] prosecutor may not place the prestige of the\n\ngovernment behind a witness by making personal assurances about the\n\nwitness'[s] credibility;’ nor may the prosecutor indicate that\n\nfacts outside the jury's cognizance support the testimony of the\n\ngovernment's witnesses.\"         United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (citation omitted; alterations in original); see United\n\nStates v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1197 (1st Cir. 1996).                     These\n\nprohibitions encompass assurances that the government \"can monitor\n\nand accurately verify the truthfulness of the witness’ testimony.\"\n\nUnited States v. Bowie, 892 F.2d 1494, 1498 (10th Cir. 1990).\n\n              Although these particular comments were inexpert and ill-\n\nadvised, their context belies appellants’ efforts to convert them\n\ninto plain error.       The prosecutor did not imply — at least not\n\nclearly and unequivocally — that the so-called \"verification[s]\" of\n\n\n                                         31\n\fFerguson’s story had not been introduced in evidence at trial.\n\nRather, by stating that \"[y]ou have seen a mountain of records,\"\n\nthe prosecutor implied that this corroboration consisted only of\n\ndocuments already introduced at trial.                  See United States v.\n\nDockray, 943 F.2d 152, 156 (1st Cir. 1991) (government is entitled\n\nto    rebut    defense   suggestion        that   government     witness’s    plea\n\nagreement gave him a motive to lie).              Further, the district court\n\ninstructed the jury that it was the sole arbiter of the credibility\n\nof the government witnesses and all other evidence.                Therefore, we\n\nfind no plain error.\n\nJ.    The Hobbs Act Instruction\n\n              John Meuse contends that the district court erroneously\n\ninstructed     the   jury     on    the   Hobbs   Act   count.     Although    the\n\ngovernment must prove that the establishments which appellants\n\nallegedly robbed had operated in interstate commerce, the district\n\ncourt instructed as a matter of law that the businesses at issue in\n\nthis case were engaged in interstate commerce.\n\n              As Meuse failed to object to the instruction below, we\n\nreview for plain error.            See United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739,\n\n755   (1st    Cir.   1999).         The   government    acknowledges   that    the\n\ninstruction was erroneous.            See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S.\n\n506, 522-23 (1995) (\"[A] criminal defendant [has] the right to have\n\na jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt of every\n\nelement of the crime with which he is charged.\").                  Meuse argues\n\n\n                                          32\n\fthat this was not only \"trial error\" but \"structural error,\" which\n\nis not subject to harmless-error review. See Arizona v. Fulminante,\n\n499 U.S. 279, 280 (1991).    The law is otherwise, however.    See\n\nNeder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 1836-37\n\n(1999).   As Meuse does not dispute that the government introduced\n\noverwhelming evidence that the businesses at issue sold goods which\n\nmoved in interstate commerce, and it appears beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the jury would have found for the government on this\n\nelement, the error was harmless; a fortiori, it cannot have been\n\nplain error.   See Owens, 167 F.3d at 754 (finding no plain error\n\nwhere \"overwhelming\" evidence proved omitted element).\n\nK.   Sentence Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice\n\n          John Meuse claims that the district court erred in\n\nimposing a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice.   See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.     During Ferguson’s cross-examination, Meuse\n\nblurted out in open court:   \"I want to fire [my] lawyer because I\n\nbelieve she’s working with the prosecution.\"       Thereafter, in\n\nvarious colloquies with the court, Meuse requested a severance,\n\nclaimed that he had told his attorney earlier in the day that he\n\nintended to fire her, and maintained that he had been forced to\n\nblurt out the above information in open court once he realized that\n\nshe did not intend to convey his wishes to the court.\n\n           A district court finding that a defendant obstructed\n\njustice is reviewed only for clear error, see United States v.\n\n\n                                33\n\fCardales, 168 F.3d 548, 558 (1st Cir. 1999), and where the record\n\nsupports at least two permissible inferences, the factfinder’s\n\nchoice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. See United States\n\nv. Veilleux, 949 F.2d 522, 525 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n             The record contained ample support for a preponderance-\n\nof-the-evidence finding that Meuse uttered this statement with\n\nintent to obstruct the trial and gain an advantageous severance,\n\nsee United States v. Feldman, 83 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 1996),\n\nwhereas the Meuse claim depended entirely on his self-serving\n\ncharacterization of the relevant events.         His counsel represented\n\nto the district court that Meuse had not requested that she inform\n\nthe court that Meuse wanted to fire her, but only that he was\n\nunhappy with the Ferguson cross-examination and was considering\n\nwhether or not to dismiss her.        Given the equivocal account which\n\nMeuse     gave   of   their   conversation,21   the   district   court,   as\n\nfactfinder, was entitled to credit counsel’s version. The district\n\ncourt noted as well that earlier Thomas Meuse had used his attorney\n\nto pass notes to the court.         Thus, John Meuse plainly was aware\n\nthat there were other means of communicating with the court besides\n\nblurting out his concerns in open court.\n\n             Thus, the record amply supported the district court\n\nfinding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Meuse \"calculated\n\n\n     21\n      After the district court twice asked if Meuse had requested\nthat his attorney so inform the court, Meuse could only respond: \"I\nthought I made it clear.\"\n\n                                      34\n\f[his outburst] to create the greatest damage to his trial,\" in\n\nhopes of obtaining a belated severance.\n\nL.   The Restitution Order\n\n            Finally, Todd Arsenault argues that the district court\n\nerred in ordering $70,000 in restitution, without first considering\n\nhis ability to pay.     He claims a limited future-earning potential\n\non the ground that he had reported income totaling only $1383 in\n\nthe preceding ten-year period, has serious medical and emotional\n\nproblems, and little education or vocational training.\n\n            We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee United States v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 52 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nSentencing courts need not make explicit factual findings on the\n\nfive factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3664(a), including the\n\ndefendant’s ability to pay, United States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579,\n\n591 (1st Cir. 1997), provided the record supports any implicit\n\nfinding. In this case, the district court specifically stated that\n\nit had reviewed the presentence report, which included a detailed\n\noutline of Arsenault’s financial prospects.               Significantly, it\n\nreflected   that    Arsenault   would    be   relatively    young   when   he\n\ncompleted   his    five-year    prison   sentence   and    would    have   the\n\nopportunity to work at his father’s business.         Finally, Arsenault\n\nwas ordered to repay a mere 20% of the losses sustained by his\n\nvictims.    We discern no abuse of discretion in the restitutionary\n\norder.\n\n\n                                    35\n\f                               III\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          Appellants’ many other arguments having been carefully\n\nconsidered as well, and having been determined meritless, we affirm\n\ntheir respective convictions and sentences.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                36\n\f",

We affirm the district court judgment in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While employed as an electrician at BayBank in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1989, Thomas Meuse stole the bank's blueprints. Later, he recruited his friend James Ferguson, a convicted armed robber, as well as several other accomplices, to rob the bank. Meuse planned to cut a hole in the roof at night, through which Ferguson could gain access. Once inside, Ferguson was to wait until bank employees arrived for work the following morning, threaten them with a gun, then force them to open the vaults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 7, 1990, Meuse and Ferguson, along with other accomplices, committed the BayBank robbery as planned and made away with approximately $125,000. Over the next eleven months, the group robbed fourteen other banks and business establishments in the Boston area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Meuse participated in almost all the robberies which took place prior to his arrest in August 1990. James Ferguson participated in all the robberies. The remaining appellants -- John Meuse (Thomas Meuse's brother), Todd Arsenault, Stephen Balsam, and Joseph Zackular -- joined the conspiracy later.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Meuse was indicted in December 1994 on a single count of aiding and abetting an armed bank robbery. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(a), (d); id. &#167; 2(a). Over the next six months, four superseding indictments issued, adding various charges and codefendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Following further discovery and extensive pretrial-motion practice, the forty-eight-day trial began in March 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James Ferguson, a prime government witness whose testimony spanned eight days, described the criminal activities of his codefendants in lurid detail.

The Speedy Trial Act Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Meuse claims that the trial was delayed for more than seventy nonexcludable days in violation of the Speedy Trial Act (STA). See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1). There was no reversible error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 1995, Thomas Meuse and the government submitted a joint motion to continue the hearing on Meuse's various pretrial motions. The motion stipulated that the \"[t]he government [was] in the process of providing defense counsel with 79 transcripts of recorded conversations as well as other discovery materials,\" and that \"[o]nce that process is complete, the parties will be in a better position to agree on certain [discovery-related] matters and to conduct a meaningful hearing before the Court.\" Through counsel, Meuse expressly agreed that the requested continuance would \"serve the ends of justice and that such action outweighs the best interests of the public and the defendants in a speedy trial.\" Although it allowed the continuance, the district court did not simultaneously reschedule the hearing date. Ultimately, the hearing took place on January 22, 1996 -- 206 days after the fourth superseding indictment had been filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STA states that \"interest of justice\" continuances are to be excluded in computing the maximum seventy-day STA time period. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Based on our decision in United States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1998), Meuse contends that open-ended continuances under section 3161(h)(8)(A) should be strongly disfavored. Barnes is readily distinguishable, however. There the district court had ordered a continuance on its own motion, without defense counsel's consent and with no explanation as to how the continuance would serve the interests of justice. By contrast, Meuse consented to this continuance, and the joint motion itself explained the grounds for the delay. See id. at 13 (noting that the court need not articulate its explanation for a continuance where the reasons are apparent, i.e., \"set forth in the motion papers\"). Furthermore, the open-ended continuance was granted because the parties suggested no date certain for rescheduling the hearing. See United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 508 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"[I]n some cases . . . a court is forced to order an (h)(8) continuance without knowing exactly how long the reasons supporting the continuance will remain valid.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meuse further contends that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance by endorsing the continuance. Meuse states that he told his attorney at the outset to accept no continuance because Meuse believed that the government had not yet gathered sufficient evidence to convict. Although we normally decline to address ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal, see United States v. Ademaj, 170 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 1999), the present record is sufficiently developed to enable us to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to demonstrate ineffective assistance, a defendant must prove that defense counsel's decision was (1) so deficient that it did not come within the \"wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\" and (2) actually prejudiced the defense. United States v. Ortiz, 146 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the conclusory assertion that the government lacked the evidence to convict, the record discloses that on May 5, 1995 the government and the defense were engaged in exchanging voluminous discovery materials -- including dozens of transcripts of incriminating tape-recorded conversations -- in a highly complex criminal case potentially involving multiple defendants. Moreover, after Meuse dismissed his first attorney, replacement counsel vigorously proceeded with various pretrial and discovery motions. Based on the sheer volume of the discovery materials disclosed by the government, Meuse's attorneys would have rendered less than effective assistance had they insisted on proceeding to trial precipitously, without adequate opportunity to review the strengths and weaknesses of the government's evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the present record does not demonstrate that the 206-day delay prejudiced the Thomas Meuse defense. For one thing, the defense relied heavily on the taped conversations to impeach Ferguson, the prime prosecution witness. See, e.g., infra Section II.H.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> There was no STA violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Sealing of the Fourth Superseding Indictment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Meuse and Todd Arsenault contend that it was improper to seal the fourth superseding indictment filed in June 1995 since the government did not disclose the reasons for doing so, and further, that the government chose to seal the indictment in order to gather additional evidence against the defendants, not because it needed more time to arrest defendants. Finally, they urge dismissal on the ground that only a properly sealed indictment tolls the statute of limitations and the limitations period had elapsed before the court unsealed the fourth superseding indictment in February 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Criminal Rule 6(e)(4) provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal magistrate judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pending trial. Thereupon the clerk shall seal the indictment and no person shall disclose the return of the indictment except when necessary for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(4). Rule 6(e) rests on the premise that criminal defendants not yet in custody may elude arrest upon learning of their indictment. Once the court sealed the fourth superseding indictment in this case, arrest warrants were issued against Arsenault, Balsam and Zackular, who had not yet been taken into custody on the federal charges. Contrary to appellants' contention, moreover, the government need not articulate its reasons for requesting that an indictment be sealed, so long as its request is based on a ground set forth in Rule 6(e). See, e.g., United States v. LaLiberte, 131 F.R.D. 20, 20-21 (D. Mass. 1990); United States v. Maroun, 699 F. Supp. 5, 6-7 (D. Mass 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their further assertion -- that the government utilized the sealing procedure as a ruse -- is meritless. Rule 6(e) does not \"forbid the sealing of an indictment for any reason other than taking a defendant into custody . . . [but] a magistrate may grant the government's request . . . 'for any legitimate prosecutorial objective or where the public interest otherwise requires it.'\" United States v. Richard, 943 F.2d 115, 118 (1st Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). In the present case, the government needed to take steps to place cooperating defendant Ferguson in a witness protection program during the summer of 1995. The protection of a key prosecution witness undoubtedly qualifies as a legitimate prosecutorial objective. See id. at 119 (citing with approval United States v. Ramey, 791 F.2d 317, 318 (4th Cir. 1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, appellants contend that the government should have returned to court to inform the magistrate judge of its new objective. Appellants cite no authority for their contention, however, and the authority we have found is to the contrary. See id. (finding \"no authority for the implied proposition that the government must return to the magistrate as each new reason for continuing the sealing order arises\"). Finally, appellants point to no evidence that the ensuing seven-month delay was either pretextual or unreasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore affirm the refusal to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Courtroom Seating Arrangements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing the small courtroom and the attendant security concerns, the district court directed that the defendants be seated in the front row of the spectator section, rather than beside their respective counsel at the defense table. John Meuse claims that the mandated seating arrangement prevented or restrained defendants from exercising their Sixth Amendment right to communicate with counsel at trial. Further, he argues that these arrangements improperly undercut the presumption of innocence, as the jury may have inferred from the isolated grouping of the defendants that they must be conconspirators, as charged, and because the court security officers rose to their feet each time defendants got up to consult with counsel, thus perhaps intimating to the jury that defendants posed a security risk. Finally, Meuse faults the district court for failing even to consider the alternative seating arrangement proposed by the defendants, which would have moved the defense counsel table forward two or three feet, thereby enabling the defendants to be seated in a row directly behind their respective counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As courtroom seating arrangements \"depend[] upon such a variety of factors, e.g., the size of the courtroom, the number of spectators, the number of defendants and lawyers, acoustics, security provisions, etc.,\" we will not disturb the trial court decision for anything less than \"a clearcut abuse of discretion.\" United States v. Turkette, 656 F.2d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 1981); cf. United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that, in light of courtroom security concerns, appellate court normally defers to reasonable conditions for admitting trial spectators). Appellants have not met their burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court ruled that its seating arrangement was necessary due to the limited space available in the small courtroom, and by the obvious security concerns which might arise if ten people were to be seated at or behind the defense table. Under the district court plan, moreover, the five defendants were seated only four to five feet from the defense table, in the front row of the spectator section. The trial judge also assured the defendants that they could consult freely with their attorneys as they wished, either by walking the short distance to the defense table, or passing written notes. See United States v. Sorrentino, 726 F.2d 876, 887 (1st Cir. 1984) (finding that arrangement caused no hindrance in communications). Thus, in practical terms the seating arrangement imposed no significant impediment upon defendants' Sixth Amendment right to consult with trial counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it apparent that defendants sustained any other significant or unwarranted prejudice. The front row in the spectator section is not an inherently prejudicial location for seating criminal defendants. See Turkette, 656 F.2d at 10. Furthermore, it is by no means clear that seating the defendants as a group directly behind the defense table, as they proposed, would have lessened any slim chance that the jury would draw an improper inference of guilt by association. Moreover, their proposal presented logistical problems, as it required that ten persons be seated in a cramped area, which would block one of the gates in the bar rail and require that all witnesses be rerouted through the remaining gate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, their characterization of the court security officers' movements -- as \"defensive\" -- is subjective and conclusory. The record in no way suggests that the security officers' actions were either so dramatic or unusual as to influence the jury unduly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore discern no clearcut abuse of discretion in the district court ruling. See id. at 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Meuse claims that the government adduced insufficient evidence that he knew Ferguson would use a gun during their armed robbery of the Somerset Savings Bank on February 10, 1990, and that this court must therefore reverse his conviction for aiding and abetting Ferguson in the use of a firearm during that robbery. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). More particularly, Meuse argues that although he and Ferguson did discuss the need to use a firearm for the Lynn BayBank robbery in January 1990, they did not do so in regard to the Somerset Savings Bank robbery, in which a significantly different modus operandi was employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to convict Meuse of aiding and abetting, it was necessary for the government to prove that he knew to a \"practical certainty,\" United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir. 1995), that Ferguson would use a gun in the Somerset Savings Bank robbery. The government did so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Meuse exaggerates the dissimilarities in the modi operandi employed in the two robberies. He planned and instigated these robberies because he had worked inside both banks, as an electrician, and was familiar with their layouts and security systems. In discussions with Ferguson prior to the first robbery, Meuse proposed to bypass the security systems by cutting through the bank's roof. He suggested that Ferguson be lowered into the bank to await the early arrival of bank employees, whom Ferguson was to threaten with a weapon in order to gain access to the vaults. Afterward, Ferguson was to flee in a getaway car manned by Meuse and their accomplices. The same essential elements were utilized in the first two robberies, as well as in several later robberies. Although Ferguson did not testify that he and Meuse again spoke about using a gun immediately prior to the second robbery, the very absence of any such discussion on the second occasion fairly invited a rational jury inference that the second bank robbery was to be conducted in essentially the same manner, including the intimidation of bank employees with a gun, successfully employed in the first robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was other evidence as well from which the jury rationally could find that Meuse himself carried the gun to the second bank robbery. Ferguson testified that, following the first robbery, he gave Meuse the gym bag which contained not only Ferguson's 9mm semiautomatic pistol but also the tools Meuse had used to cut a hole in the Lynn BayBank roof. Meuse took the bag home with him; then, as Ferguson testified, Meuse carried it to the second robbery. Thus, the jury rationally could infer that upon opening the gym bag to retrieve the cutting tools needed to penetrate the Somerset Bank roof, Meuse would have seen the gun. Moreover, Ferguson testified that he used the same weapon in both robberies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, see Guerrero, 114 F.3d at 339, the evidence supported a rational inference that Meuse knew to a \"practical certainty\" that Ferguson would use a gun in the second robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The Guilty Plea Colloquy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Meuse next contends that the district court erred in admitting into evidence the state-court plea colloquy which took place at the time he pled guilty to charges arising out of his abortive August 1990 robbery of Lloyd's Diamond &amp; Gold. Citing Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997), Meuse contends that his agreement to stipulate to this earlier guilty plea barred the government from adducing any further evidence about either the prior conviction or the underlying robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidentiary rulings under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 are reviewed only for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Tse, 135 F.3d 200, 208 (1st Cir. 1998). In his state-court plea colloquy, Meuse admitted that he and Sean Cote had used burglary tools in an attempt to cut through the Lloyd's Jewelry Store roof, and when detected by police, had fired on the police while attempting unsuccessfully to escape in a stolen car. Meuse pled guilty to attempted breaking and entering, assault with a dangerous weapon, and unlawful possession of an electric weapon (stun gun), burglary tools, and a stolen vehicle. As this abortive robbery was also the subject matter of the Hobbs Act conspiracy count charged in the federal indictment against Meuse, the plea colloquy clearly was admissible as an admission probative of his guilt on the Hobbs Act count. See United States v. De Leon Ruiz, 47 F.3d 452, 455 (1st Cir. 1995); Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Thus, reliance on Old Chief was misplaced, since the government in that case had charged the defendant with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). The Supreme Court therefore held that the government must accept the defendant's offer to stipulate to the fact of the prior conviction, but could not adduce evidentiary details of the underlying crime. See Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 177, 190 (\"[T]he fact of the qualifying [prior felony] conviction is alone what matters under [18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1)].\"). However, the bases for the Supreme Court ruling were (i) that \"proof of the defendant's [felon] status goes to an element entirely outside the natural sequence of what the defendant is charged with thinking and doing to commit the current offense [viz., possessing the firearm],\" id. at 191, and (ii) that the defendant's proffered stipulation was fully adequate to prove his felon status, whereas a jury informed that defendant previously committed a serious assault might infer that he had a \"bad character,\" and this evidence of propensity would cause defendant \"unfair prejudice\" under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, id. at 180-86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, however, \"the prosecutor's choice [not to accept a defendant's stipulation] will generally survive a Rule 403 analysis when a defendant seeks to force the substitution of an admission for evidence creating a coherent narrative of his thoughts and actions in perpetrating the offense for which he is being tried.\" Id. at 192. The Meuse plea colloquy plainly fit the latter mold, for in it he described conduct specifically charged in the federal indictment; i.e., his August 1990 armed robbery. We discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. The Rule 404(b) Objections</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph Zackular and John Meuse challenge various evidentiary rulings pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> These rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion only. See United States v. Mangual-Corchado, 139 F.3d 34, 43 n.22 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Zackular submitted a motion in limine announcing his intention to cross-examine Ferguson to expose his personal bias against Zackular; specifically, that following his arrest Ferguson had attempted to have Zackular murdered. Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, Zackular contended that the government should not be allowed to introduce evidence as to the basis for Ferguson's animus; i.e., that Ferguson mistakenly believed that Zackular, who had been under indictment for unrelated federal extortion charges in 1990, had implicated Ferguson in the robberies which took place in 1990 in order to obtain favorable treatment from the government in Zackular's extortion case. In November 1990, Zackular pled guilty to conspiring to transmit threats in interstate commerce. Ferguson was arrested in December 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not permit the government to establish that Zackular had been convicted of extortion, the government was allowed to introduce evidence that a criminal case was pending against Zackular in 1990. The district court determined that the probative value of this limited proof -- i.e., providing the jury with the \"complete story\" relating to Ferguson's alleged bias -- substantially outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Zackular's claim, no per se rule bars the government's introduction of evidence clearly relevant to a jury's assessment of a government witness's bias.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Absent any explanation for Ferguson's animus toward Zackular, the jury might be misled to conclude that Ferguson's feelings were irrational or arbitrary. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 530 F.2d 1076, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (\"[T]he trier [of fact] must be sufficiently informed of the underlying relationships, circumstances and influences operating on a witness so that, in light of his experience, he can determine whether a mutation in testimony could reasonably be expected as a probable human reaction.\") (citation omitted). Since the district court substantially dampened the prejudicial effect of the evidence by not allowing the government to demonstrate that Zackular had been convicted of extortion, we cannot conclude that it abused its discretion in drawing the Rule 403 balance as it did. See United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d 796, 800 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that appellate courts rarely disturb a \"debatable\" Rule 403 determination).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony of Jeannette Dion that Dion feared her former boyfriend, John Meuse. First, the court did not permit Dion to describe specific \"bad acts\" which might explain the grounds for her fear. Further, the Dion testimony was relevant, as it explained her reluctance to testify as a government witness. Any countervailing prejudicial effect was slight, as Dion testified that she had been fearful of Meuse on but one occasion, and was \"not afraid of him otherwise.\" Any error was harmless as well, given the direct evidence of Meuse's guilt (e.g., the Ferguson testimony). See, e.g., United States v. Harris, 165 F.3d 1062, 1066 (6th Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, asked what Meuse had done with the robbery proceeds, Dion testified that he had bought marijuana. As Meuse preserved no objection to this evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> we review for plain error only. See United States v. Conley, 186 F.3d 7, 21 n.15 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Plain errors are 'those errors so shocking that they seriously affect the fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings conducted below.'\") (citation omitted). Meuse incorrectly asserts that this drug evidence was totally unrelated to the crimes charged (i.e., armed robbery). Cf., e.g., United States v. Currier, 821 F.2d 52, 56 &amp; n.7 (1st Cir. 1987) (drug sale unrelated to firearms charge). It was relevant at least insofar as it demonstrated that Meuse had bought many expensive gifts for Dion while he had no source of legitimate income, which made it somewhat more likely that he had used robbery proceeds to do so. As this isolated, brief reference to marijuana almost certainly had no significant prejudicial effect on the jury, we find no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. The Juror Misconduct Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants fault the district court for failing to \"voir dire\" the jury after counsel to John Meuse reported having observed jurors examining one another's notes. Appellants insist that the trial judge was duty-bound to investigate these allegations. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d 436, 442 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district courts are better situated to determine whether juror misconduct occurred and prejudice resulted, we normally review their remediation measures only for a patent abuse of discretion. See United States v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1998). \"The trial judge is not . . . shackled to a rigid and unyielding set [of] rules and procedures that compel any particular form or scope of inquiry,\" Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d at 443, but should be left free to fashion a remedy appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances, see id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As counsel for John Meuse was the one person in the courtroom who reportedly observed the alleged misconduct, the district court simply instructed the jurors that they were not to look at each other's notes. Since appellants failed to move for a mistrial, the remediation measures selected by the district court are reviewed only for plain error. See id. at 442. And since the misconduct in question was uncorroborated,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> and did not raise the same specter of prejudice as improper outside influences upon the jury, cf. id. at 443 (voir dire conducted where juror allegedly discussed case with daughter, who was seen speaking with defendant's girlfriend); cf. also United States v. Bertoli, 40 F.3d 1384, 1394 (3d Cir. 1994), we find no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">H. Limitations on Cross-examination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zackular claims that the district court erred in denying him an unrestricted opportunity to play the tape recordings of Ferguson's jailhouse conversations in an effort to show that Ferguson was biased and lacked credibility. See Fed. R. Evid. 608(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The proffered tape recordings graphically described Ferguson's efforts to have Zackular killed. Since the defense theory turned principally upon Ferguson's personal animus toward, and motives for falsely implicating, Zackular, it is Zackular's contention that the district court ruling violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confrontation clause challenges are reviewed de novo to determine whether defense counsel was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses; once that threshold is reached, the trial court's restrictions on the extent and manner of cross-examination are reviewed only for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Gomes, 177 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 1999). The Zackular claims fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, during the cross-examination of Ferguson, Zackular's counsel elicited an admission that Ferguson had tried to have Zackular killed. Moreover, Zackular played two taped conversations in which Ferguson described his antagonism; for example, Ferguson threatened to \"blow [Zackular's] head off.\" As the jury was adequately apprised of the nature and vehemence of Ferguson's feelings toward Zackular, Zackular was afforded an adequate opportunity to impeach the witness in conformance with the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court expressly ruled that Zackular would be permitted to play any tape recording which disclosed Ferguson's bias. See id. at 81 (\"[E]xtrinsic evidence is admissible to show [witness] bias.\"). Inexplicably, however, Zackular has identified no particular tape excerpt which he was precluded from using. See United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that appellate court will deem waived \"issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner\"). Finally, the district court correctly held that the recordings could not be used to undermine Ferguson's credibility. See Gomes, 177 F.3d at 81 (\"Extrinsic evidence of specific bad acts is not admissible to show untruthfulness.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that their convictions must be set aside due to improper closing arguments by the prosecution. First, they assert that the prosecutor intimated that defendants had the burden of proof and that they should have taken the stand. For instance, the prosecutor stated: \"Did you hear any effort made [by the defense] . . . to ask [Ferguson] about whether he had ever made any inconsistent statements [e.g., in his taped conversations] about [appellants' involvement in] these robberies?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Closing arguments are reviewed de novo and reversible error will be found only if the arguments were \"'both inappropriate and harmful.'\" United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). Prosecutorial comments will be found harmful if, \"in the totality of the circumstances, they would probably have affected the outcome of the trial.\" Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution may not comment on a defendant's failure to take the witness stand in his own defense. See Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring). Nevertheless, the government \"may focus on the absence of impeachment [of government witnesses] during cross-examination so long as [its] comments are 'sufficiently circumscribed and [do] not necessarily implicate appellant's assertion of his fifth amendment right' not to take the stand in his own defense.\" United States v. Goldman, 563 F.2d 501, 505 (1st Cir. 1977) (citation omitted; final alteration in original); see Hall v. United States, 46 F.3d 855, 858 (8th Cir. 1995); cf. United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1338 (1st Cir. 1994) (observing that prosecution comments concerning the plausibility of a defense theory do not shift the burden of proof to the defense). Although it is a source of continual amazement to us that prosecutors would choose \"to hand [a] defendant an issue on which to appeal,\" see Goldman, 563 F.2d at 505, these closing arguments -- viewed in their totality and context -- expressly focused only on defects in the cross-examination of Ferguson by the defense, without inevitably implying that appellants should have taken the stand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellants complain that the government vouched for Ferguson's credibility. After observing that Ferguson would lose the benefits of his plea bargain were he to perjure himself, the prosecutor stated: \"[Ferguson would] just throw that away, knowing that he would have two federal prosecutors, agents, going out checking everything he is saying, verifying. . . . You have seen a mountain of records . . . all of this stuff is being checked and verified, the things that he is saying. . . . Judge Lindsay, who has heard all of this [viz., the government's case] for the last three months and particularly James Ferguson for three weeks, will make that decision as to what sentence to give him.\" (Emphasis added.) Appellants argue that these comments suggested to the jury that the prosecutor or the judge knew of evidence, never disclosed to the jury, which would confirm that Ferguson was telling the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As appellants failed to object to the closing remarks, we review only for plain error. See United States v. Smith, 101 F.3d 202, 213 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 769 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that a \"plain error\" is one which \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the trial process\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"'[A] prosecutor may not place the prestige of the government behind a witness by making personal assurances about the witness'[s] credibility;' nor may the prosecutor indicate that facts outside the jury's cognizance support the testimony of the government's witnesses.\" United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1999) (citation omitted; alterations in original); see United States v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1197 (1st Cir. 1996). These prohibitions encompass assurances that the government \"can monitor and accurately verify the truthfulness of the witness' testimony.\" United States v. Bowie, 892 F.2d 1494, 1498 (10th Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these particular comments were inexpert and ill-advised, their context belies appellants' efforts to convert them into plain error. The prosecutor did not imply -- at least not clearly and unequivocally -- that the so-called \"verification[s]\" of Ferguson's story had not been introduced in evidence at trial. Rather, by stating that \"[y]ou have seen a mountain of records,\" the prosecutor implied that this corroboration consisted only of documents already introduced at trial. See United States v. Dockray, 943 F.2d 152, 156 (1st Cir. 1991) (government is entitled to rebut defense suggestion that government witness's plea agreement gave him a motive to lie). Further, the district court instructed the jury that it was the sole arbiter of the credibility of the government witnesses and all other evidence. Therefore, we find no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">J. The Hobbs Act Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Meuse contends that the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the Hobbs Act count. Although the government must prove that the establishments which appellants allegedly robbed had operated in interstate commerce, the district court instructed as a matter of law that the businesses at issue in this case were engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Meuse failed to object to the instruction below, we review for plain error. See United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 755 (1st Cir. 1999). The government acknowledges that the instruction was erroneous. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 522-23 (1995) (\"[A] criminal defendant [has] the right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt of every element of the crime with which he is charged.\"). Meuse argues that this was not only \"trial error\" but \"structural error,\" which is not subject to harmless-error review. See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 280 (1991). The law is otherwise, however. See Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 1836-37 (1999). As Meuse does not dispute that the government introduced overwhelming evidence that the businesses at issue sold goods which moved in interstate commerce, and it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found for the government on this element, the error was harmless; a fortiori, it cannot have been plain error. See Owens, 167 F.3d at 754 (finding no plain error where \"overwhelming\" evidence proved omitted element).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">K. Sentence Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Meuse claims that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1. During Ferguson's cross-examination, Meuse blurted out in open court: \"I want to fire [my] lawyer because I believe she's working with the prosecution.\" Thereafter, in various colloquies with the court, Meuse requested a severance, claimed that he had told his attorney earlier in the day that he intended to fire her, and maintained that he had been forced to blurt out the above information in open court once he realized that she did not intend to convey his wishes to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court finding that a defendant obstructed justice is reviewed only for clear error, see United States v. Cardales, 168 F.3d 548, 558 (1st Cir. 1999), and where the record supports at least two permissible inferences, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. See United States v. Veilleux, 949 F.2d 522, 525 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contained ample support for a preponderance-of-the-evidence finding that Meuse uttered this statement with intent to obstruct the trial and gain an advantageous severance, see United States v. Feldman, 83 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 1996), whereas the Meuse claim depended entirely on his self-serving characterization of the relevant events. His counsel represented to the district court that Meuse had not requested that she inform the court that Meuse wanted to fire her, but only that he was unhappy with the Ferguson cross-examination and was considering whether or not to dismiss her. Given the equivocal account which Meuse gave of their conversation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> the district court, as factfinder, was entitled to credit counsel's version. The district court noted as well that earlier Thomas Meuse had used his attorney to pass notes to the court. Thus, John Meuse plainly was aware that there were other means of communicating with the court besides blurting out his concerns in open court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the record amply supported the district court finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Meuse \"calculated [his outburst] to create the greatest damage to his trial,\" in hopes of obtaining a belated severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">L. The Restitution Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Todd Arsenault argues that the district court erred in ordering $70,000 in restitution, without first considering his ability to pay. He claims a limited future-earning potential on the ground that he had reported income totaling only $1383 in the preceding ten-year period, has serious medical and emotional problems, and little education or vocational training.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion. See United States v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 52 (1st Cir. 1999). Sentencing courts need not make explicit factual findings on the five factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(a), including the defendant's ability to pay, United States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579, 591 (1st Cir. 1997), provided the record supports any implicit finding. In this case, the district court specifically stated that it had reviewed the presentence report, which included a detailed outline of Arsenault's financial prospects. Significantly, it reflected that Arsenault would be relatively young when he completed his five-year prison sentence and would have the opportunity to work at his father's business. Finally, Arsenault was ordered to repay a mere 20% of the losses sustained by his victims. We discern no abuse of discretion in the restitutionary order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' many other arguments having been carefully considered as well, and having been determined meritless, we affirm their respective convictions and sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These were: Somerset Savings Bank (2/90); a Stoneham jewelry store (3/90); Malden Trust Company (3/90); Warren Five Cents Savings Bank (4/90); Woburn BayBank (5/90); Lynn BayBank (5/90); Malden BayBank (5/90); East Boston Savings Bank (6/90); Depositors' Trust Company (7/90); Lloyd's Diamond &amp; Gold (8/90); Gallahue's Market (9/90); Everett Cooperative Bank (9/90); Woburn BayBank (10/90); and Capital Bank &amp; Trust (11/90).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> John Meuse joined in March 1990, Arsenault in May 1990, Balsam in August 1990. Zackular's involvement developed more gradually: Ferguson used proceeds from the January 1990 robbery to buy a car from a dealership owned by Zackular. Over the next several months, the two became friends. Eventually, Ferguson confided in Zackular that the money used to buy the car had been stolen. At that time, Zackular advised Ferguson how to set up a sham business to conceal the source of the stolen funds. Eventually, Zackular asked if he could participate in the last two robberies, which occurred during October and November 1990.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The additional charges included: conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; armed bank robbery, id. &#167; 2113; using a firearm in a crime of violence, id. &#167; 924(c)(1); and conspiring to affect commerce by means of robbery, id. &#167; 1951.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Thomas Meuse was sentenced to 627 months; John Meuse 336; Zackular 262; Balsam 204; Arsenault 60.

For example, the evidence corroborated the Ferguson testimony that Zackular had asked to become directly involved in the final robberies in 1990 in order to get money to pay for his defense in the extortion case. We may affirm the district court on any ground apparent from the record. See United States v.

Barnes is readily distinguishable, however. There the district court had ordered a continuance on its own motion, without defense counsel's consent and with no explanation as to how the continuance would serve the interests of justice. By contrast, Meuse consented to this continuance, and the joint motion itself explained the grounds for the delay.

Moreover, after Meuse dismissed his first attorney, replacement counsel vigorously proceeded with various pretrial and discovery motions. Based on the sheer volume of the discovery materials disclosed by the government, Meuse's attorneys would have rendered less than effective assistance had they insisted on proceeding to trial precipitously, without adequate opportunity to review the strengths and weaknesses of the government's evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the present record does not demonstrate that the 206-day delay prejudiced the Thomas Meuse defense. For one thing, the defense relied heavily on the taped conversations to impeach Ferguson, the prime prosecution witness.

Finally, they urge dismissal on the ground that only a properly sealed indictment tolls the statute of limitations and the limitations period had elapsed before the court unsealed the fourth superseding indictment in February 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Criminal Rule 6(e)(4) provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal magistrate judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pending trial.

Once the court sealed the fourth superseding indictment in this case, arrest warrants were issued against Arsenault, Balsam and Zackular, who had not yet been taken into custody on the federal charges. Contrary to appellants' contention, moreover, the government need not articulate its reasons for requesting that an indictment be sealed, so long as its request is based on a ground set forth in Rule 6(e). See, e.g., United States v. LaLiberte, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, 20-21 (D.

The Courtroom Seating Arrangements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing the small courtroom and the attendant security concerns, the district court directed that the defendants be seated in the front row of the spectator section, rather than beside their respective counsel at the defense table. John Meuse claims that the mandated seating arrangement prevented or restrained defendants from exercising their Sixth Amendment right to communicate with counsel at trial. Further, he argues that these arrangements improperly undercut the presumption of innocence, as the jury may have inferred from the isolated grouping of the defendants that they must be conconspirators, as charged, and because the court security officers rose to their feet each time defendants got up to consult with counsel, thus perhaps intimating to the jury that defendants posed a security risk. Finally, Meuse faults the district court for failing even to consider the alternative seating arrangement proposed by the defendants, which would have moved the defense counsel table forward two or three feet, thereby enabling the defendants to be seated in a row directly behind their respective counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As courtroom seating arrangements \"depend[] upon such a variety of factors, e.g., the size of the courtroom, the number of spectators, the number of defendants and lawyers, acoustics, security provisions, etc.,\" we will not disturb the trial court decision for anything less than \"a clearcut abuse of discretion.\" United States v.

Appellants have not met their burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court ruled that its seating arrangement was necessary due to the limited space available in the small courtroom, and by the obvious security concerns which might arise if ten people were to be seated at or behind the defense table. Under the district court plan, moreover, the five defendants were seated only four to five feet from the defense table, in the front row of the spectator section. The trial judge also assured the defendants that they could consult freely with their attorneys as they wished, either by walking the short distance to the defense table, or passing written notes. See United States v. Sorrentino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430882\"><a href=\"/opinion/430882/united-states-v-staniford-a-sorrentino/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>, 887 (1st Cir. 1984) (finding that arrangement caused no hindrance in communications). Thus, in practical terms the seating arrangement imposed no significant impediment upon defendants' Sixth Amendment right to consult with trial counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it apparent that defendants sustained any other significant or unwarranted prejudice.

Furthermore, it is by no means clear that seating the defendants as a group directly behind the defense table, as they proposed, would have lessened any slim chance that the jury would draw an improper inference of guilt by association. Moreover, their proposal presented logistical problems, as it required that ten persons be seated in a cramped area, which would block one of the gates in the bar rail and require that all witnesses be rerouted through the remaining gate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, their characterization of the court security officers' movements -- as \"defensive\" -- is subjective and conclusory.

The Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Meuse claims that the government adduced insufficient evidence that he knew Ferguson would use a gun during their armed robbery of the Somerset Savings Bank on February 10, 1990, and that this court must therefore reverse his conviction for aiding and abetting Ferguson in the use of a firearm during that robbery. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). More particularly, Meuse argues that although he and Ferguson did discuss the need to use a firearm for the Lynn BayBank robbery in January 1990, they did not do so in regard to the Somerset Savings Bank robbery, in which a significantly different modus operandi was employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to convict Meuse of aiding and abetting, it was necessary for the government to prove that he knew to a \"practical certainty,\" United States v.

The government did so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Meuse exaggerates the dissimilarities in the modi operandi employed in the two robberies. He planned and instigated these robberies because he had worked inside both banks, as an electrician, and was familiar with their layouts and security systems. In discussions with Ferguson prior to the first robbery, Meuse proposed to bypass the security systems by cutting through the bank's roof. He suggested that Ferguson be lowered into the bank to await the early arrival of bank employees, whom Ferguson was to threaten with a weapon in order to gain access to the vaults. Afterward, Ferguson was to flee in a getaway car manned by Meuse and their accomplices. The same essential elements were utilized in the first two robberies, as well as in several later robberies. Although Ferguson did not testify that he and Meuse again spoke about using a gun immediately prior to the second robbery, the very absence of any such discussion on the second occasion fairly invited a rational jury inference that the second bank robbery was to be conducted in essentially the same manner, including the intimidation of bank employees with a gun, successfully employed in the first robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was other evidence as well from which the jury rationally could find that Meuse himself carried the gun to the second bank robbery. Ferguson testified that, following the first robbery, he gave Meuse the gym bag which contained not only Ferguson's 9mm semiautomatic pistol but also the tools Meuse had used to cut a hole in the Lynn BayBank roof. Meuse took the bag home with him; then, as Ferguson testified, Meuse carried it to the second robbery. Thus, the jury rationally could infer that upon opening the gym bag to retrieve the cutting tools needed to penetrate the Somerset Bank roof, Meuse would have seen the gun. Moreover, Ferguson testified that he used the same weapon in both robberies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Guerrero,</span> <span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">339</span></span>, the evidence supported a rational inference that Meuse knew to a \"practical certainty\" that Ferguson would use a gun in the second robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The Guilty Plea Colloquy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Meuse next contends that the district court erred in admitting into evidence the state-court plea colloquy which took place at the time he pled guilty to charges arising out of his abortive August 1990 robbery of Lloyd's Diamond &amp; Gold. Citing Old Chief v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span> </a></span>(1997), Meuse contends that his agreement to stipulate to this earlier guilty plea barred the government from adducing any further evidence about either the prior conviction or the underlying robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidentiary rulings under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 are reviewed only for abuse of discretion. See United States v.

In his state-court plea colloquy, Meuse admitted that he and Sean Cote had used burglary tools in an attempt to cut through the Lloyd's Jewelry Store roof, and when detected by police, had fired on the police while attempting unsuccessfully to escape in a stolen car. Meuse pled guilty to attempted breaking and entering, assault with a dangerous weapon, and unlawful possession of an electric weapon (stun gun), burglary tools, and a stolen vehicle. As this abortive robbery was also the subject matter of the Hobbs Act conspiracy count charged in the federal indictment against Meuse, the plea colloquy clearly was admissible as an admission probative of his guilt on the Hobbs Act count. See United States v. De Leon Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195881\"><a href=\"/opinion/195881/united-states-v-de-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 455 (1st Cir. 1995); Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Thus, reliance on Old Chief was misplaced, since the government in that case had charged the defendant with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). The Supreme Court therefore held that the government must accept the defendant's offer to stipulate to the fact of the prior conviction, but could not adduce evidentiary details of the underlying crime. See Old <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Chief,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span>, 190 (\"[T]he fact of the qualifying [prior felony] conviction is alone what matters under [18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1)].\"). However, the bases for the Supreme Court ruling were (i) that \"proof of the defendant's [felon] status goes to an element entirely outside the natural sequence of what the defendant is charged with thinking and doing to commit the current offense [viz., possessing the firearm],\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 191, </span>and (ii) that the defendant's proffered stipulation was fully adequate to prove his felon status, whereas a jury informed that defendant previously committed a serious assault might infer that he had a \"bad character,\" and this evidence of propensity would cause defendant \"unfair prejudice\" under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 180-86.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, however, \"the prosecutor's choice [not to accept a defendant's stipulation] will generally survive a Rule 403 analysis when a defendant seeks to force the substitution of an admission for evidence creating a coherent narrative of his thoughts and actions in perpetrating the offense for which he is being tried.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 192. </span>The Meuse plea colloquy plainly fit the latter mold, for in it he described conduct specifically charged in the federal indictment; i.e., his August 1990 armed robbery.

See United States v. Mangual-Corchado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752407\"><a href=\"/opinion/752407/united-states-v-saul-mangual-corchado-united-states-of-america-v-ernesto/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43 n.22 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Zackular submitted a motion in limine announcing his intention to cross-examine Ferguson to expose his personal bias against Zackular; specifically, that following his arrest Ferguson had attempted to have Zackular murdered. Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, Zackular contended that the government should not be allowed to introduce evidence as to the basis for Ferguson's animus; i.e., that Ferguson mistakenly believed that Zackular, who had been under indictment for unrelated federal extortion charges in 1990, had implicated Ferguson in the robberies which took place in 1990 in order to obtain favorable treatment from the government in Zackular's extortion case. In November 1990, Zackular pled guilty to conspiring to transmit threats in interstate commerce. Ferguson was arrested in December 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not permit the government to establish that Zackular had been convicted of extortion, the government was allowed to introduce evidence that a criminal case was pending against Zackular in 1990. The district court determined that the probative value of this limited proof -- i.e., providing the jury with the \"complete story\" relating to Ferguson's alleged bias -- substantially outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Zackular's claim, no per se rule bars the government's introduction of evidence clearly relevant to a jury's assessment of a government witness's bias.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Absent any explanation for Ferguson's animus toward Zackular, the jury might be misled to conclude that Ferguson's feelings were irrational or arbitrary. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"333678\"><a href=\"/opinion/333678/united-states-v-garnell-s-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span>, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (\"[T]he trier [of fact] must be sufficiently informed of the underlying relationships, circumstances and influences operating on a witness so that, in light of his experience, he can determine whether a mutation in testimony could reasonably be expected as a probable human reaction.\") (citation omitted). Since the district court substantially dampened the prejudicial effect of the evidence by not allowing the government to demonstrate that Zackular had been convicted of extortion, we cannot conclude that it abused its discretion in drawing the Rule 403 balance as it did. See United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698646\"><a href=\"/opinion/698646/united-states-v-esperanza-aguilar-aranceta/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span>, 800 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that appellate courts rarely disturb a \"debatable\" Rule 403 determination).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony of Jeannette Dion that Dion feared her former boyfriend, John Meuse. First, the court did not permit Dion to describe specific \"bad acts\" which might explain the grounds for her fear. Further, the Dion testimony was relevant, as it explained her reluctance to testify as a government witness. Any countervailing prejudicial effect was slight, as Dion testified that she had been fearful of Meuse on but one occasion, and was \"not afraid of him otherwise.\" Any error was harmless as well, given the direct evidence of Meuse's guilt (e.g., the Ferguson testimony). See, e.g., United States v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760890\"><a href=\"/opinion/760890/united-states-v-mashaun-harris-97-6283-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1062</span></a></span>, 1066 (6th Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, asked what Meuse had done with the robbery proceeds, Dion testified that he had bought marijuana. As Meuse preserved no objection to this evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> we review for plain error only. See United States v. Conley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765470\"><a href=\"/opinion/765470/united-states-v-kenneth-m-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 21 n.15 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Plain errors are 'those errors so shocking that they seriously affect the fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings conducted below.'\") (citation omitted). Meuse incorrectly asserts that this drug evidence was totally unrelated to the crimes charged (i.e., armed robbery). Cf., e.g., United States v. Currier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489945\"><a href=\"/opinion/489945/united-states-v-raymond-leon-currier-united-states-of-america-v-raymond/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 56 &amp; n.7 (1st Cir. 1987) (drug sale unrelated to firearms charge). It was relevant at least insofar as it demonstrated that Meuse had bought many expensive gifts for Dion while he had no source of legitimate income, which made it somewhat more likely that he had used robbery proceeds to do so. As this isolated, brief reference to marijuana almost certainly had no significant prejudicial effect on the jury, we find no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G.

See Fed. R. Evid. 608(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The proffered tape recordings graphically described Ferguson's efforts to have Zackular killed. Since the defense theory turned principally upon Ferguson's personal animus toward, and motives for falsely implicating, Zackular, it is Zackular's contention that the district court ruling violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confrontation clause challenges are reviewed de novo to determine whether defense counsel was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses; once that threshold is reached, the trial court's restrictions on the extent and manner of cross-examination are reviewed only for abuse of discretion. See United States v.

Moreover, Zackular played two taped conversations in which Ferguson described his antagonism; for example, Ferguson threatened to \"blow [Zackular's] head off.\" As the jury was adequately apprised of the nature and vehemence of Ferguson's feelings toward Zackular, Zackular was afforded an adequate opportunity to impeach the witness in conformance with the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court expressly ruled that Zackular would be permitted to play any tape recording which disclosed Ferguson's bias.

You have seen a mountain of records . . . all of this stuff is being checked and verified, the things that he is saying. . . . Judge Lindsay, who has heard all of this [viz., the government's case] for the last three months and particularly James Ferguson for three weeks, will make that decision as to what sentence to give him.\" (Emphasis added.)

As Meuse does not dispute that the government introduced overwhelming evidence that the businesses at issue sold goods which moved in interstate commerce, and it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found for the government on this element, the error was harmless; a fortiori, it cannot have been plain error.

See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1. During Ferguson's cross-examination, Meuse blurted out in open court: \"I want to fire [my] lawyer because I believe she's working with the prosecution.\" Thereafter, in various colloquies with the court, Meuse requested a severance, claimed that he had told his attorney earlier in the day that he intended to fire her, and maintained that he had been forced to blurt out the above information in open court once he realized that she did not intend to convey his wishes to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court finding that a defendant obstructed justice is reviewed only for clear error, see United States v. Cardales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198339\"><a href=\"/opinion/198339/united-states-v-julio-cardales/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 558 (1st Cir. 1999), and where the record supports at least two permissible inferences, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. See United States v. Veilleux, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572410\"><a href=\"/opinion/572410/united-states-v-timothy-lee-veilleux/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 525 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contained ample support for a preponderance-of-the-evidence finding that Meuse uttered this statement with intent to obstruct the trial and gain an advantageous severance, see United States v. Feldman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196731\"><a href=\"/opinion/196731/united-states-v-feldman/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir. 1996), whereas the Meuse claim depended entirely on his self-serving characterization of the relevant events. His counsel represented to the district court that Meuse had not requested that she inform the court that Meuse wanted to fire her, but only that he was unhappy with the Ferguson cross-examination and was considering whether or not to dismiss her. Given the equivocal account which Meuse gave of their conversation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> the district court, as factfinder, was entitled to credit counsel's version. The district court noted as well that earlier Thomas Meuse had used his attorney to pass notes to the court. Thus, John Meuse plainly was aware that there were other means of communicating with the court besides blurting out his concerns in open court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the record amply supported the district court finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Meuse \"calculated [his outburst] to create the greatest damage to his trial,\" in hopes of obtaining a belated severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">L. The Restitution Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Todd Arsenault argues that the district court erred in ordering $70,000 in restitution, without first considering his ability to pay. He claims a limited future-earning potential on the ground that he had reported income totaling only $1383 in the preceding ten-year period, has serious medical and emotional problems, and little education or vocational training.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion. See United States v. LiCausi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198296\"><a href=\"/opinion/198296/united-states-v-licausi/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir. 1999). Sentencing courts need not make explicit factual findings on the five factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(a), including the defendant's ability to pay, United States v. Vaknin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197346\"><a href=\"/opinion/197346/united-states-v-vaknin/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 591 (1st Cir. 1997), provided the record supports any implicit finding. In this case, the district court specifically stated that it had reviewed the presentence report, which included a detailed outline of Arsenault's financial prospects. Significantly, it reflected that Arsenault would be relatively young when he completed his five-year prison sentence and would have the opportunity to work at his father's business. Finally, Arsenault was ordered to repay a mere 20% of the losses sustained by his victims. We discern no abuse of discretion in the restitutionary order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' many other arguments having been carefully considered as well, and having been determined meritless, we affirm their respective convictions and sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These were: Somerset Savings Bank (2/90); a Stoneham jewelry store (3/90); Malden Trust Company (3/90); Warren Five Cents Savings Bank (4/90); Woburn BayBank (5/90); Lynn BayBank (5/90); Malden BayBank (5/90); East Boston Savings Bank (6/90); Depositors' Trust Company (7/90); Lloyd's Diamond &amp; Gold (8/90); Gallahue's Market (9/90); Everett Cooperative Bank (9/90); Woburn BayBank (10/90); and Capital Bank &amp; Trust (11/90).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> John Meuse joined in March 1990, Arsenault in May 1990, Balsam in August 1990.

Over the next several months, the two became friends. Eventually, Ferguson confided in Zackular that the money used to buy the car had been stolen. At that time, Zackular advised Ferguson how to set up a sham business to conceal the source of the stolen funds. Eventually, Zackular asked if he could participate in the last two robberies, which occurred during October and November 1990.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The additional charges included: conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; armed bank robbery, id. &#167; 2113; using a firearm in a crime of violence, id. &#167; 924(c)(1); and conspiring to affect commerce by means of robbery, id. &#167; 1951.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Thomas Meuse was sentenced to 627 months; John Meuse 336; Zackular 262; Balsam 204; Arsenault 60.
