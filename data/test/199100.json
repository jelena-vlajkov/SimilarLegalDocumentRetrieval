Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n              Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Joseph Waldbaum on brief for appellant.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Alex Whiting,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                      September 28, 2000\n\f\f                 Per Curiam.      Following a bench trial, the district\n\ncourt found defendant-appellant John Sweeney, Jr., guilty on one\n\ncount of criminal contempt of a court order.                   See United States\n\nv. Sweeney, 52 F. Supp. 2d 164 (D. Mass. 1999).                        Sweeney now\n\nappeals, complaining that the government charged and tried him\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) rather than 18 U.S.C. § 402 in\n\norder to deny him a trial by jury, 1 and that this charging\n\ndecision abridged his constitutional rights.                   See, e.g., United\n\nStates      v.     Pyle,   518   F.   Supp.    139,   145-46   (E.D.    Pa.   1981)\n\n(holding that defendants who were charged under section 401, but\n\nwho could have been charged under section 402, were denied their\n\nconstitutional right to trial by jury), aff'd without opinion,\n\n722 F.2d 736 (3d Cir. 1983).              Since Sweeney did not raise this\n\nclaim squarely in the lower court, our review is limited to\n\nplain error.           See United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30-31\n\n(1st       Cir.    1992)   (holding    that    a   single   reference,     without\n\nelaboration, was insufficient to preserve a claim for appellate\n\nreview).          We discern none.    Consequently, we affirm the judgment\n\nof conviction.\n\n                 Sweeney's difficulties arose when the Resolution Trust\n\nCorporation (RTC), as successor in interest to a failed state-\n\n\n\n       1\n     Both statutes provide for punishment for contempt of a\ncourt order, but only section 402 provides for trial by jury.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fchartered bank, successfully prosecuted a foreclosure proceeding\n\ninvolving Sweeney's properties.           See Sweeney v. RTC, 16 F.3d 1,\n\n3 (1st Cir. 1994).      The RTC, succeeded in due course by the\n\nFederal   Deposit   Insurance    Corporation      (FDIC),   initiated    an\n\naction    for   possession,   and   the     district   court   entered   an\n\neviction order on May 29, 1997.       Sweeney exhausted his appeals,\n\nbut refused to quit and vacate.       The FDIC obtained another order\n\nfrom the district court, dated February 19, 1998, commanding\n\nSweeney to leave immediately upon service.          Sweeney paid no heed\n\nand a squad of U.S. Marshals forcibly removed him from the\n\npremises on February 28, 1998.              On the same date, he was\n\narrested and charged with contempt.            His trial and conviction\n\nfollowed.\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the instant appeal.\n\nTo show that the government prosecuted him under the wrong\n\nstatute, Sweeney must demonstrate that the FDIC's action against\n\nhim was not \"brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf\n\nof, the United States.\"       18 U.S.C. § 402.     Inasmuch as Congress\n\ninserted a jury trial provision in section 402 in order to\n\nprevent abuse by \"private litigants\" seeking to use the judicial\n\ncontempt power as an \"instrument of private law enforcement,\"\n\nUnited States v. Wright, 516 F. Supp. 1113, 1116 (E.D. Pa. 1981)\n\n(citations omitted), the FDIC may be said to be acting \"in the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fname of, or on behalf of, the United States\" for purposes of\n\nsection 402 only insofar as its actions serve public (as opposed\n\nto private) ends.     In any given case, the answer to this\n\nconundrum hinges on the particular statute under which the\n\nunderlying actions were taken.    See Auction Co. of Am. v. FDIC,\n\n132 F.3d 746, 748 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\n          According to Sweeney, the FDIC was acting here not to\n\nadvance any public goal, but, rather, to protect the interests\n\nof the depositors and creditors of the failed state-chartered\n\nbank.   The decision in FDIC v. Sumner Financial Corp., 602 F.2d\n\n670 (5th Cir. 1979), lends credence to this position.      There,\n\nthe Fifth Circuit distinguished between the FDIC's actions qua\n\nreceiver of insolvent banks, and its actions qua insurer of\n\nstate-chartered banks.   See id. at 679.   The court held that, in\n\nits former capacity, the FDIC was \"to be treated exactly as any\n\nother receiver would be,\" and therefore was not acting as the\n\nUnited States for purposes of federal jurisdiction under the\n\nversion of 12 U.S.C. § 1819 then in effect.     Id.\n\n          The fly in the ointment, however, is that the decision\n\nin Sumner preceded the enactment of the Financial Institutions\n\nReform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-73,\n\n103 Stat. 183 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 12\n\nU.S.C.) (FIRREA).   Congress enacted FIRREA \"to aid the FDIC in\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fits immediate responsibilities of dealing with mounting bank\n\nfailures in this country.\"         FDIC v. Longley I Realty Trust, 988\n\nF.2d 270, 274 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting FDIC v. Wright, 942 F.2d\n\n1089,   1096   (7th    Cir.   1991)).      In   so   doing,   Congress     made\n\npellucid that, in acting as a receiver of failed banks, the FDIC\n\nfosters important public policies relating to the avoidance of\n\na national banking crisis.          See id.     This assessment reflects\n\nthe gist of post-FIRREA authority.          See, e.g., FDIC v. Wentz, 55\n\nF.3d    905,   909    (3d   Cir.   1995)   (stating    that      there   is   \"a\n\nsignificant public interest in promptly resolving the affairs of\n\ninsolvent banks\"); RTC v. Thornton, 41 F.3d 1539, 1542 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1994) (explaining that in resolving the affairs of failed\n\nbanks, the RTC and its successor, the FDIC, are required not\n\nonly to protect the assets of the failed institution for its\n\ndepositors and creditors but also to \"make efficient use of\n\npublic funds\") (citing 12 U.S.C. § 1441a(b)(3)(C)); Wright, 942\n\nF.2d at 1096 (holding that an action involving the FDIC as\n\nreceiver is not \"simply a private case between individuals [but\n\none that] involves a federal agency appointed as a receiver of\n\na failed bank in the midst of a national banking crisis\").                    We\n\nagree   with   these    courts.      And   insofar    as   the   FDIC    serves\n\nimportant public purposes when it functions as a receiver, it\n\n                                     -6-\n\fmay be said to be acting \"in the name of, or on behalf of, the\n\nUnited States\" within the purview of section 402.\n\n         For present purposes, we need not answer definitively\n\nthe question of whether the FDIC, as a receiver of a failed\n\nstate-chartered bank, is acting \"in the name of, or on behalf\n\nof, the United States\" within the purview of section 402.    It\n\nsuffices that the question is, at the very least, an open one.\n\nAs such, Sweeney's professed entitlement to a jury trial is\n\nfreighted with uncertainty.\n\n         We need go no further.     Since \"plain error\" must be\n\njust that — clear-cut, patent, and obvious — no plain error\n\noccurs when the state of the law is murky.      Thus, Sweeney's\n\nappeal fails.\n\n\n\n         Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f",

FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184381\"><a href=\"/opinion/184381/auction-company-amer-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>, 748 (D.C. Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Sweeney, the FDIC was acting here not to advance any public goal, but, rather, to protect the interests of the depositors and creditors of the failed state-chartered bank. The decision in FDIC v. Sumner Financial Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368308\"><a href=\"/opinion/368308/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-receiver-of-the-peoples-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span> </a></span>(5th Cir. 1979), lends credence to this position. There, the Fifth Circuit distinguished between the FDIC's actions qua receiver of insolvent banks, and its actions qua insurer of state-chartered banks. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368308\"><a href=\"/opinion/368308/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-receiver-of-the-peoples-state/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 679. </a></span>The court held that, in its former capacity, the FDIC was \"to be treated exactly as any other receiver would be,\" and therefore was not acting as the United States for purposes of federal jurisdiction under the version of 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1819 then in effect. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fly in the ointment, however, is that the decision in Sumner preceded the enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 12 U.S.C.) (FIRREA). Congress enacted FIRREA \"to aid the FDIC in its immediate responsibilities of dealing with mounting bank failures in this country.\" FDIC v. Longley I Realty Trust, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602346\"><a href=\"/opinion/602346/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-longley-i-realty-trust-angeline/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 274 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting FDIC v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567220\"><a href=\"/opinion/567220/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-receiver-of-union-national-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span>, 1096 (7th Cir. 1991)). In so doing, Congress made pellucid that, in acting as a receiver of failed banks, the FDIC fosters important public policies relating to the avoidance of a national banking crisis. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567220\"><a href=\"/opinion/567220/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-receiver-of-union-national-bank/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> This assessment </a></span>reflects the gist of post-FIRREA authority. See, e.g., FDIC v. Wentz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696575\"><a href=\"/opinion/696575/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-receiver-for-the-howard-savings/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span>, 909 (3d Cir. 1995) (stating that there is \"a significant public interest in promptly resolving the affairs of insolvent banks\"); RTC v. Thornton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684066\"><a href=\"/opinion/684066/resolution-trust-corporation-v-grant-thornton/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1539</span></a></span>, 1542 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (explaining that in resolving the affairs of failed banks, the RTC and its successor, the FDIC, are required not only to protect the assets of the failed institution for its depositors and creditors but also to \"make efficient use of public funds\") (citing 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1441a(b)(3)(C)); <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567220\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wright,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/567220/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-receiver-of-union-national-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1096</span> </a></span>(holding that an action involving the FDIC as receiver is not \"simply a private case between individuals [but one that] involves a federal agency appointed as a receiver of a failed bank in the midst of a national banking crisis\"). We agree with these courts. And insofar as the FDIC serves important public purposes when it functions as a receiver, it may be said to be acting \"in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States\" within the purview of section 402.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, we need not answer definitively the question of whether the FDIC, as a receiver of a failed state-chartered bank, is acting \"in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States\" within the purview of section 402. It suffices that the question is, at the very least, an open one. As such, Sweeney's professed entitlement to a jury trial is freighted with uncertainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
