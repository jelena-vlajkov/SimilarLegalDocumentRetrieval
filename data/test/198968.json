Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Selya, Boudin, and Lynch,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Jonathan Shapiro, with whom Stern, Shapiro, Weissberg & Garin was\non brief, for appellant.\n     Paula J. DeGiacomo, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Donald K.\nStern, United States Attorney, and Diana K. Lloyd, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\f                             June 16, 2000\n\n           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.          A jury convicted Troy Footman\n\nof various federal crimes on evidence that he was a pimp,\n\nrunning a ring of prostitutes who were transported across state\n\nlines from Massachusetts to Delaware.          Footman was convicted of\n\none count of conspiring to transport women, including three\n\nminors, across state lines for the purpose of prostitution, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; four counts of transporting minors\n\nacross state lines for the purpose of prostitution, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2423(a); one count of transporting an adult\n\nacross state lines for the purpose of prostitution, in violation\n\nof 18    U.S.C.   §§   2,   2421;   and    twelve   counts   of   using   an\n\ninterstate facility to distribute the proceeds of prostitution\n\nactivities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1952(a)(1).             He was\n\ntried alone, although Kimyou Tes, one of the women involved in\n\nthe prostitution ring, was described as a co-conspirator.1\n\n\n\n\n     1    The government originally charged Tes with conspiracy and\ncharged her under a number of the substantive offense counts but\ndropped the charges after Footman was convicted.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           Footman,   ably   represented    by   counsel,    says   his\n\nconviction must fall because the evidence was not sufficient to\n\nprove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury was not properly\n\ninstructed, and some evidence -- Footman's own bragging and\n\nthreatening statements in recorded telephone conversations from\n\nprison -- was improperly obtained.       He also complains about the\n\ndistrict court's sentencing that resulted, through several\n\nupward departures, in a sentence of 15 years, about twice the\n\nmandatory minimum.     Counsel's arguments are not frivolous; but\n\nneither are they sufficient, and we affirm both the verdict and\n\nthe sentence.2\n\n           This appeal requires that we resolve for the first time\n\nthe issue of whether the Massachusetts prison system's practice\n\nof intercepting and recording inmate telephone calls violates\n\nTitle III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2510 et. seq. (\"Title III\").       It also requires further\n\ndelineation of the distinction between being a mere victim of a\n\nconspiracy and being a co-conspirator.\n\n                                   I\n\n     2     Footman has also filed a pro se brief, raising arguments that\nhave no merit. We have considered them and there is no need to extend\nthe discussion beyond the issues raised by counsel.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           We recite the essential facts as a reasonable jury\n\ncould have found them and in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment.    See United States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436, 438\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).    A fuller description of the facts may be found\n\nin the district court's sentencing opinion.         See United States\n\nv. Footman, 66 F. Supp. 2d 83 (D. Mass. 1999).\n\n           Footman, assisted by Tes and another prostitute, Rita\n\nBoykins, ran a prostitution business that included three minors,\n\nS.O., age seventeen, A.M., age seventeen, and J-3, who was only\n\nfourteen years old.3 Footman recruited S.O. from a Massachusetts\n\nstate courtroom, where he told her that, in order to get back\n\ncustody of her infant daughter, she would need to earn money.\n\nShe went to work as a prostitute in Chinatown and gave her money\n\nto Footman.   A.M. became a prostitute for Footman when she was\n\nsixteen years old and worked at the trade in Boston.          J-3, the\n\n14 year old, was trained in how to be a prostitute in 1996 by\n\nanother woman in Footman's menagerie, on his instructions \"just\n\nto show her what to do and tell her it was fun.\"         J-3 could not\n\n\n\n     3     We refer to the eldest two girls using their initials, as the\ndistrict court did. We refer to the youngest girl as J-3 (the term\nused to describe her in the indictment), as the district court did upon\na motion by the United States to protect her identity.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fgo through with her first attempt at prostitution, and one of\n\nthe other prostitutes told Footman she didn't feel that J-3 was\n\nright for it.      Footman urged patience, and eventually J-3\n\nsuccessfully worked as a prostitute.       Boykins, who was an adult\n\nduring the periods relevant to Footman's convictions, also\n\nworked as a prostitute for Footman.\n\n          Beginning in the summer of 1996, the young women were\n\ntransported to New Castle, Delaware, where they worked their\n\ntrade at a truck stop and gave their earnings to Footman.             They\n\nreceived about $10 a day for condoms and food.               There were\n\nmultiple trips to Delaware from late June or early July 1996 to\n\nMarch 1997, each trip typically lasting a few weeks.             Although\n\nFootman did not always accompany the young women to Delaware, he\n\nwould   make   appearances   there   for   a   few   days   at   a   time.\n\nDifferent prostitutes wired Footman the collective receipts,\n\nunless Footman was in Delaware, in which case the money was\n\nhanded to him directly.\n\nThe June 1996 Trip\n\n          In late June or early July 1996 Footman told A.M. that\n\nthey would be going to Delaware to work at a truck stop because\n\nthings had gotten \"hot\" with the police in Boston.               Footman\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdrove in one car, and A.M., Tes, and other prostitutes followed\n\nbehind in a second car.       Footman registered for rooms at the\n\nBudget Motel near the truck stop and took the young women to the\n\ntruck stop to begin working.     Footman told them what to charge\n\nfor different sex acts, and they gave the money they earned to\n\nhim.\n\nThe July/August 1996 Trip\n\n         A.M. and other prostitutes went to Delaware in late\n\nJuly or early August 1996, at Footman's direction.       A.M. drove\n\ndown in Footman's car with Tes.     Footman did not accompany them\n\non this trip.    Tes registered the young women at the Budget\n\nMotel, listing Footman's car as their car. A.M. wired the money\n\nthey made back to Footman.      On one occasion, A.M. also wired\n\nmoney back to Tes.\n\n         After   they   had    returned   to   Massachusetts,   A.M.\n\nattempted to leave Footman.     Footman responded by dragging A.M.\n\nout of her house into the backyard, beating her, and throwing\n\nher over a fence.    He then forced her into a car driven by Tes\n\nand took the money she had made working for an escort service.\n\nThey eventually ended up at Boykins's apartment, where Footman\n\nexplained that things would be the \"old way\" -- that A.M. would\n\n                                 -6-\n\fstay where Footman put her, would not have a boyfriend, would\n\nnot speak to other pimps, and would give Footman all the money\n\nshe made.\n\nThe October 1996 Trip\n\n            A.M., J-3, Tes, and other prostitutes drove to Delaware\n\nin October 1996.     A.M. testified that they drove in Footman's\n\ncar, but Boykins, who arrived later by bus, registered for rooms\n\nat the Budget Motel and listed Tes's Chevy Celebrity as the car\n\nthey were driving.4     Footman had told Boykins that the police\n\nweren't so bad in Delaware.\n\n            The night before A.M.'s birthday, Footman drove S.O.\n\nand another prostitute down to Delaware and dropped S.O. off.\n\nAs he had previously done with A.M., Footman had told S.O. that\n\nthings were \"hot\" in Boston with the police and that they would\n\nbe going to Delaware to work at a truck stop.         At Footman's\n\ndirection, A.M. wired Footman the money she and the other young\n\nwomen had earned from prostitution. Boykins also wired money to\n\nFootman.\n\n\n\n\n    4       Tes later transferred title of this car to Footman.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Although the date is not clear from the record, at\n\nsome point A.M. and J-3, at Footman's direction, traveled by bus\n\nto Delaware to work at the truck stop.   Footman paid for the bus\n\ntickets, and A.M. gave the money they made to Footman.\n\nThe November 1996 Trip\n\n         A.M., J-3, Tes, and other prostitutes traveled to\n\nDelaware in November 1996. Footman, Tes, and Boykins registered\n\nfor rooms for different dates during the period from November 3\n\nto December 16, 1996.     A.M., Tes, and Boykins wired money to\n\nFootman during this time.\n\n         Some time in November, while in Delaware, S.O. tried\n\nto escape from Footman.   At one point she was chased down by Tes\n\nand Footman, with Tes driving the car.   Footman brought S.O. to\n\na motel room and brutally beat and raped her.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fThe January 1997 Trip\n\n         A.M. and other prostitutes drove to Delaware again in\n\nJanuary 1997.      A.M. wired Footman the money they made from\n\nprostitution. Boykins also wired money to Footman from Delaware\n\nin January 1997.\n\n         A.M. left Delaware for about a month, traveling \"down\n\nsouth\" with a truck driver.    When she returned to Delaware in\n\nFebruary, she attempted to leave Footman to go to work for\n\nanother pimp.   When Footman found out, he beat A.M.   She again\n\nagreed to work for him.\n\nThe March 1997 Trip\n\n         Boykins drove to Delaware with Footman in March 1997\n\nand worked at the truck stop as a prostitute. They traveled in\n\nFootman's car, and Footman registered for the motel rooms.\n\nRecorded CB transmissions from March 14, 1997, show Boykins\n\ndirecting prostitution at the Delaware truck stop.\n\n                                 II\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n         Footman makes several arguments that the government's\n\nevidence was insufficient.     The arguments require a careful\n\nroadmap of the counts of conviction.   In addition to conspiracy\n\n                               -9-\n\f(count one of the indictment), Footman was convicted of five separate\n\nsubstantive transportation offenses (counts three through seven of the\n\nindictment).    Specifically, he was convicted on count three\n\n(transportation of A.M. in or about late July 1996, to in or about\n\nearly August 1996); count four (transportation of A.M. in or about\n\nOctober 1996); count five (transportation of S.O. in or about October\n\n1996); count six (transportation of J-3 in or about October 1996 and\n\nNovember 1996); and count seven (transportation of Boykins in or about\n\nMarch 1997).5 In reviewing Footman's sufficiency claims, we view\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the government,\n\ndrawing all legitimate inferences and resolving all credibility\n\nconflicts in its favor. See United States v. Sabatino, 943 F.2d\n\n94, 97 (1st Cir. 1991).6\n\n1. Conspiracy (Count One)\n\n          Footman argues, correctly, that a conspiracy of one\n\nperson is no conspiracy at all.     The government had charged him\n\n\n     5    Footman was acquitted on count        two of the indictment\n(transportation of A.M. in or about late June   1996 to in or about early\nJuly 1996). He does not raise sufficiency of    the evidence claims with\nregard to his convictions on counts five        and six.\n     6     The government argues that Footman failed to preserve his\nsufficiency claims and that, as a result, our review is for \"clear and\ngross\" injustice. United States v. Upham, 168 F.3d 532, 537 (1st Cir.\n1999). Because we are able to affirm Footman's convictions under the\nstandard less burdensome to Footman, we do not address the issue of\nwhether Footman adequately preserved these claims for appeal.\n\n                                -10-\n\fwith conspiring with Kimyou Tes, one of the prostitutes, to\n\ntransport adults and three minors across state lines for the\n\npurpose of prostitution.        But Tes was never tried and the\n\ncharges against her were dismissed.7 Footman says Tes was a mere\n\nvictim and that a woman who simply prostitutes herself under the\n\ncontrol of a pimp and consents to being transported across state\n\nlines cannot be a co-conspirator under the Mann Act.         There is\n\nlaw to this effect.    See Gebardi v. United States, 287 U.S. 112,\n\n123 (1932) (\"[W]e perceive in the failure of the Mann Act to\n\ncondemn the woman's participation in those transportations which\n\nare effected with her mere consent, evidence of an affirmative\n\nlegislative policy to leave her acquiescence unpunished.\").\n\nSpecifically,    Footman   argues   that   there   was   insufficient\n\nevidence that Tes ever entered any agreement with him to\n\naccomplish the goals of the conspiracy.        See United States v.\n\nColon-Munoz, 192 F.3d 210, 226 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n     7    Footman also complains about the government's \"cynical\"\ntactics in naming Tes as a co-conspirator and then dismissing the\ncharges against her. The government's reasons, whether admirable,\ntactical, or cynical, were the stuff of prosecutorial discretion and do\nnot raise any additional issues for consideration on appeal.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          In support of the conclusion that \"Tes was a mere\n\nvictim,\" Footman relies most heavily on statements made by the\n\ntrial judge at sentencing.   The judge said:\n\n                 In the instant case, none of the women, with\n          exception of Tes, was included in the indictment.\n          Plainly, the indictment and the proof offered by the\n          government, characterized the women and girls instead\n          as victims, not participants.     Everything I heard\n          confirms this fact.\n                 Furthermore, although Tes was originally\n          included in the indictment with Footm[a]n, charges\n          against her were subsequently dismissed. Nothing I\n          heard in the trial, or read in the parties'\n          submissions persuades me that Tes was in a different\n          category than the other women or girls. Thus, I find\n          that there were no \"participants\" involved with\n          Footman in these crimes . . . .\n\nFootman, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 93.        This argument based on the\n\ndistrict judge's comments at sentencing is largely beside the\n\npoint.   The question of guilt was for the jury to decide, and to\n\nfocus on what the trial judge said is to focus on the wrong\n\nactor at trial. See United States v. Pitocchelli, 830 F.2d 401,\n\n403 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n          The real question is whether the jury had adequate\n\nevidence to conclude that Tes was more than a victim -- that she\n\nwas in fact a co-conspirator. The dividing line is an important\n\none.   There is an inherent policy judgment in the Mann Act not\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fto prosecute women who do no more than consent to being\n\ntransported across state lines for the purpose of prostitution.\n\nBut that policy simply does not apply when the women assume\n\nroles in running the business.         Thus, in Sabatino this court\n\nupheld the conspiracy conviction of a wife who played an active\n\nrole in two prostitution businesses her husband ran: an \"escort\n\nservice\" and a \"health club.\"    Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 97-98; see\n\nalso United States v. Anderson, 139 F.3d 291, 295-96, 298-99\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (affirming, in an appeal based upon other\n\ngrounds, conviction of an adult prostitute for transporting a\n\nminor   where   the   adult   prostitute's      car   was   used   in\n\ntransportation and where the adult prostitute purchased a train\n\nticket for the minor).   Footman says there is no evidence that\n\nTes was a partner, received any income, made any agreements, or\n\ncommitted any acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.        There was\n\nno evidence, he says, that she acted any differently from the\n\nothers who were under his dominion and thrall.        In particular,\n\nFootman says that the other prostitutes also registered for\n\nrooms and sent money back to him, as Tes did, and so she is\n\nindistinguishable.\n\n          It is true that many of Tes's actions were of the same\n\n                                -13-\n\fnature as the actions of some of the other prostitutes.            That is\n\nnot the crux; the issue is whether she agreed to further the\n\nconspiracy and took steps to do so, beyond her working as a\n\nprostitute herself and crossing state lines.               There is ample\n\nevidence from which a jury could conclude that she acted as\n\nFootman's    agent   and   co-conspirator.       Tes,     who   lived   with\n\nFootman, acted on Footman's behalf as transporter of the women,\n\narranger of the details of the business, occasional money\n\nhandler, and enforcer.\n\n            Tes   transported     A.M.   and   J-3   to   Delaware.     She\n\nregistered for dozens of nights of stays by the group at motels\n\nin Massachusetts and Delaware.           This was far in excess of the\n\nnumber of room registrations by the others. Importantly, unlike\n\nmost of the other prostitutes, Tes had a driver's license and an\n\nID.   Footman himself did not have a driver's license until\n\nFebruary    of    1997.     The    license     was   important     to    the\n\ntransportation scheme of driving the women to Delaware.                    A\n\ndriver with a license was needed to continue the trip if they\n\nwere stopped by the police.          In addition, Tes owned (or, at\n\nleast, allowed to be registered in her name) two of the\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fautomobiles used for transportation -- a Chevy Celebrity and a\n\nChrysler LeBaron.\n\n         Further, Tes acted as an enforcer. When A.M. attempted\n\nto free herself from Footman's control in September 1996, Tes\n\nassisted Footman in coercing her back into his employ. She also\n\nchased down S.O. in a motel parking lot in Delaware when S.O.\n\nwas attempting to escape from Footman.    This evidence, in the\n\naggregate, was adequate to support the finding that Tes had\n\nagreed to the criminal scheme and had committed overt acts in\n\nfurtherance of it.\n\n2. Substantive Counts Three, Four, and Seven\n\n         Footman also argues that the evidence was insufficient\n\nto prove that he transported A.M. (counts three and four) or\n\nBoykins (count seven) across state lines for the purpose of\n\nprostitution.\n\n         As to A.M.'s several trips to Delaware, Footman says\n\nthere is no evidence that he went with her or arranged for\n\nanyone else to transport her.       But the evidence supports a\n\nfinding that Tes was Footman's agent in transporting A.M.   A.M.\n\ntestified that she and other prostitutes went to Delaware in\n\nlate July, with Tes, at Footman's direction. The women traveled\n\n                             -15-\n\fin Footman's car, and Tes registered for the motel rooms.    A.M.\n\nwired money back to both Footman and Tes.\n\n           A.M. testified that she, J-3, and other prostitutes\n\ndrove to Delaware with Tes in October 1996. The record evidence\n\nis that the group drove down either in Footman's car or in Tes's\n\ncar.   Moreover, not long before this trip, Footman had beaten\n\nA.M., thrown her over a backyard fence, taken the money she\n\nearned working for an escort service, and told her that, from\n\nthen on, she would stay where Footman put her and would give him\n\nall the money she made.\n\n           As to Boykins, she testified that Footman traveled with\n\nher to Delaware in March 1997.        Footman says there is no\n\nevidence that he exercised any control over her or that she went\n\nto engage in prostitution.   The trip was made in his car, and he\n\nregistered for the rooms at the motel.    Boykins had prostituted\n\nfor Footman in Delaware before this trip.    A jury could easily\n\ninfer that this trip was for similar purposes. Indeed, recorded\n\nCB transmissions show she was directing prostitution at the\n\nDelaware truck stop.\n\n           Overall, the evidence was sufficient to support the\n\nverdict.\n\n                               -16-\n\fB. Jury Instructions\n\n          Footman's argument that the jury instructions were\n\nlegally   erroneous   is   pertinent   to   his   convictions   on   the\n\nsubstantive transportation counts.      Our review is de novo.       See\n\nUnited States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 68 (1st Cir. 1998).8\n\n          Footman was charged under two theories -- that he was\n\na direct participant in the Mann Act violations and that he was\n\nan aider and abetter.        Each theory has somewhat different\n\nrequirements.   For example, the direct theory under §§ 2421 and\n\n2423(a) requires that Footman \"knowingly transport[ed]\" the\n\nwomen across state lines.       18 U.S.C. § 2421, 2423(a).           The\n\nstatutory language does not literally extend to \"causing\" the\n\ntransportation.   See Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 99. Under the aiding\n\nand abetting theory, by contrast, it would suffice that Footman\n\n\"caused\" the women to be transported across state lines for the\n\npurpose of prostitution.     See 18 U.S.C. § 2(b).\n\n          The trial judge initially explained to the jury that\n\nit could convict Footman under either a direct participation\n\n     8    The government argues that Footman failed to object to the\ndistrict court's final instructions and that, as a result, our review\nis for plain error. Because we find, upon de novo review, that the\ninstructions given did not cause prejudice to Footman, we do not\naddress the issue of whether Footman preserved this claim.\n\n                                -17-\n\ftheory or an aider and abetter theory.              She then defined\n\n\"transport\" under § 2421 as \"to move or carry or cause someone\n\nto be moved or carried from one state to another.\"             Moments\n\nlater, the judge defined \"knowing transportation\" to include\n\n\"cause to be transported.\"\n\n           The judge then went on to instruct that the § 2423(a)\n\ncounts required proof of the same elements as § 2421, with the\n\nadditional element that \"the transportation needs to involve a\n\nminor.\"     In   giving   the   §   2423(a)   instruction,   the   judge\n\ndistinguished liability under the direct participant theory from\n\nliability for aiding and abetting.            The instruction was as\n\nfollows:\n\n                  In addition, then, to the two elements that I\n           have described, that the defendant did knowingly\n           transport or did counsel, command, induce, procure or\n           cause the transportation of an individual, a named\n           individual, in interstate commerce -- that's what I've\n           summarized as the knowing transportation or causing to\n           transport prong; two, that the defendant did so with\n           the intent that the individual engage in prostitution\n           or other illegal sexual activity . . . .\n\nFootman claims that the judge's instructions allowed the jury to\n\nconvict Footman \"for conduct that was not criminalized by\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f§§ 2421 and 2423(a).\"     This argument is to no avail.9      The trial\n\njudge properly instructed the jury on the difference between\n\ndirect participation liability and liability as an aider and\n\nabetter.   Any confusion generated by the judge's having defined\n\n\"knowing transportation\" under § 2421 to include \"cause to be\n\ntransported\" was corrected by her proper instruction regarding\n\n§ 2423(a).\n\n           Even if the earlier instructions defining \"knowing\n\ntransportation\"    were   in   error,   there   was   no   prejudice   to\n\nFootman, as there is no \"pure\" theory of direct liability.10\n\n     9     In his brief, Footman points to the trial judge's last\ninstruction (the one including the \"counsel, command, induce\" language)\nin his claim that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury. That\nlast instruction was a correct statement of the law, and it clearly\narticulated the elements for both the direct participation and the\naiding and abetting theories of criminal liability. We assume\nFootman's argument that the trial judge committed error is really in\nresponse to her having defined \"knowing transportation,\" on a number of\noccasions, to include \"cause to be transported.\" These statements did\nnot correctly describe the elements of § 2421. As already noted,\n\"transport\" in § 2421 does not include \"causing\" the transportation of\nan individual. See Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 99.\n           Footman may also be claiming that it was improper to instruct\nthe jury on aiding and abetting liability at all. If so, this argument\nis without merit. Footman was charged under both the substantive\nstatutory sections and the aiding and abetting statute, and the\nevidence put on by the government sufficed to allow the issue to go to\nthe jury.\n     10   A different situation might arise in a case where the\nprosecution's theory was that the defendant \"caused\" the prostitute to\ntransport herself across state lines by persuading her to do so,\nwhether by sweet talk, for a bonus, or the like. In such a case, the\n\n                                 -19-\n\f\"[A]n aider and abettor charge is implicit in all indictments\n\nfor substantive offenses, so it need not be specifically pleaded\n\nfor   an   aiding     and    abetting   conviction   to   be   returned.\"\n\nSabatino, 943 F.2d at 99-100.           As the revisor's note to § 2\n\nstates, \"one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal\n\nenterprise . . . is guilty as a principal even though he\n\nintentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the\n\ncompleted offense.\"         18 U.S.C. § 2 revisor's note.      When aiding\n\nand   abetting   is    involved,    then,   the   \"counsels,    commands,\n\ninduces, or procures\" and \"cause\" language from § 2 is properly\n\npart of the jury's instruction. Cf. United States v. Leppo, 177\n\nF.3d 93, 95 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 501 (1999)\n\n(harmless error for trial judge to include \"willfully causes\"\n\nlanguage from § 2(b) as part of definition of \"transport\" under\n\nstatute criminalizing \"transport[]\" of stolen goods).\n\nC. Admission of Footman's Recorded Telephone Calls\n\n           The district court admitted evidence in the form of\n\nrecordings of telephone calls Footman made from prison to Tes\n\n\nquestion of whether the \"causation\" involved would suffice to\nconstitute knowing transportation under the substantive statutory\nsections is a real question. That was not the evidence or the\ngovernment's theory here, and so we do not need to explore this nuanced\nmeaning of the phrase \"knowingly transport.\"\n\n                                    -20-\n\fand others.     In those calls, Footman described himself as a\n\npimp, threatened the women with harm if they revealed any\n\ninformation, and made statements that supported the government's\n\nversion of the facts. Footman says these calls were recorded in\n\nviolation of Title III and that they should have been excluded\n\nas evidence.    We review the district court's fact findings for\n\nclear error and review its conclusions of law de novo.            See\n\nUnited States v. Beras, 183 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          At the state prison in Concord, Massachusetts, all\n\ninmate calls, except calls to designated attorneys, are recorded\n\nand subject to monitoring.     See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 103, §\n\n482.   In order to use the phones, inmates are required to sign\n\na form stating that they understand that their calls will be\n\nmonitored and recorded.     Large stickers on the phones remind\n\ninmates that their calls are being recorded.       A third notice\n\ncomes at the start of each call, when a pre-recorded message\n\ntells both parties to the call that \"[a]ll call detail and\n\nconversation,   excluding   approved   attorney   calls,   will   be\n\nrecorded.\"    Footman's calls were made in this context.\n\n          In civil prison conditions cases, this court has\n\nalluded to but not decided the issue of whether the interception\n\n                               -21-\n\f(and recording) of inmate calls violates Title III.                 See Gilday\n\nv. Dubois, 124 F.3d 277, 296-98 (1st Cir. 1997);                    Langton v.\n\nHogan,       71 F.3d. 930, 935-37 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n               The government introduced the calls on the theory that\n\nthey        were   consensual   and   so    admissible    under     18    U.S.C.\n\n§   2511(2)(c),        which    refers     to    \"prior   consent    to     such\n\ninterception.\"11        The government claimed that there was valid\n\nconsent from both parties to the telephone calls.                 Footman had\n\nsigned the form giving his consent to recording as a condition\n\nof making the calls, and, the argument went, the recipients of\n\nthe calls consented by accepting the calls after listening to\n\nthe recorded warning that the calls could be recorded.\n\n               It is settled law that only one party need consent to\n\nthe interception of the calls.             See United States v. Pratt, 913\n\nF.2d 982, 986-87 (1st Cir. 1990).               The district court held that\n\nthe recipient's consent was valid, but that the consent of the\n\nprisoner was not.        See United States v. Footman, 33 F. Supp. 2d\n\n60, 64 (D. Mass. 1998).          The result -- that there was a valid\n\n\n\n       11  The government had another theory of admissibility: that the\ncalls were placed on telephone equipment being used in the ordinary\ncourse of their duties by investigative or law enforcement officers.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 2510(5)(a)(ii). We do not reach this argument.\n\n                                      -22-\n\fconsent -- is correct, but our reasoning is different.                 In our\n\nview, the consent of the prisoner is valid and there is no need\n\nto go further.       We do not reach the question of whether the\n\nother party to the call consented.\n\n            The question of consent, either express or implied, may\n\nvary with the circumstances of the parties.             See Griggs-Ryan v.\n\nSmith, 904 F.2d 112, 116-17 (1st Cir. 1990).             Footman does not\n\nmake   a   Fourth   Amendment    argument,     but   raises     a    statutory\n\nquestion under Title III.       Here, Footman expressly acknowledged\n\nhis understanding that his use of the prison telephones was\n\nconditioned on his calls being monitored and recorded.                   Even\n\nexpress consents, though, may be treated as invalid under some\n\ncircumstances,      such   as   where   they   result    from       overriding\n\ncoercion.     See 2 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure\n\n§4.3(c), at 361 n.87 (2d ed. 1999).             In Langton, this court\n\nquestioned whether consent could be premised upon an inmate's\n\nhaving to choose between making no phone calls and agreeing to\n\nhave his phone calls recorded.          See 71 F.3d at 936.            Footman\n\nargues that this is the position he was in, and that it is\n\nKafkaesque to say his consent was voluntary. Footman urges that\n\nthe government may not \"condition access to even a gratuitous\n\n                                   -23-\n\fbenefit   or   privilege    it   bestows    upon   the   sacrifice     of   a\n\nconstitutional right.\"       Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 568\n\n(1st Cir. 1985).\n\n           In literal terms, Blackburn -- which involved consent\n\nto strip searches and thus violations of bodily integrity --\n\ndoes not apply here.       Prisoners have no per se constitutional\n\nright to use a telephone, and the violation urged here is of a\n\nstatute, not the Constitution.            Nonetheless, the argument by\n\nanalogy must still be addressed as to whether extracting consent\n\nas a condition of access to a telephone call by a prisoner means\n\nthe consent is not voluntary, and so is invalid.\n\n           Whatever the merits of that argument outside of the\n\nprison context, where privacy interests are stronger,12 it has\n\nlittle force when the person giving consent is in confinement.\n\nPrison    inmates   have   few   expectations      of   privacy   in   their\n\ncommunications.     Cf. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-28\n\n(1984).    There is no reason to think that Congress would not\n\n\n     12    Title III itself explicitly considers that those engaged in\noral communications may have reduced privacy expectations and assumes\nthat there are protectable privacy interests in wire communications.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 2510(1), (2). We do not address whether those privacy\ninterests are given up by a person, outside of the prison context,\nmerely because she accepts a call that has been preceded by a phone\ncompany announcement that the call is being recorded.\n\n                                   -24-\n\fhave included within the meaning of consent a prison inmate's\n\nexpress acceptance of having his calls recorded as a condition\n\nof using the telephone.13      This is particularly so given the\n\n\"deference    and   flexibility\"    federal   courts    afford   state\n\nofficials in managing prisons.14 Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472,\n\n482 (1995).\n\n          Other circuits have reached this same conclusion --\n\nthat prison inmates in Footman's position have given their\n\nconsent for purposes of Title III.            See United States v.\n\nWorkman, 80 F.3d 688, 692-94 (2d Cir. 1996); United States v.\n\nVan Poyck, 77 F.3d 285, 292 (9th Cir. 1996); United States v.\n\nHorr, 963 F.2d 1124, 1126 (8th Cir. 1992). But see United States\n\nv. Daniels, 902 F.2d 1238, 1244-45 (7th Cir. 1990) (expressing\n\nreservations about finding Title III's consent requirement satisfied in\n\nthis context).\n\n\n\n\n     13   In passing the legislation, Congress was concerned with\nprotecting the privacy of individual citizens while providing for the\neffective use of electronic surveillance to combat organized crime.\nSee S. Rep. No. 90-1097 (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112,\n2153-63. There is little reason to believe that Congress was concerned\nwith the privacy interests of prison inmates.\n     14   There may, of course, be \"occasional applications that might\nraise hard questions.\"      Langton, 71 F.3d at 941 (Boudin, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n                                 -25-\n\f            There was no violation of Title III and no error in\n\nadmitting the evidence.\n\nD. Sentencing\n\n            Footman   argues   that    the   district   court    erred   in\n\ndeparting    upward    under   two    provisions   of   the     Sentencing\n\nGuidelines in determining his sentence.\n\n1. Departure under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3\n\n            The district court departed upward, at the government's\n\nrequest, under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3 on the ground that Footman's\n\nCriminal History Category (CHC) of III did not \"adequately\n\nreflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct\n\nor the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.3      Footman's adjusted CHC was VI.\n\n            Footman says that the district court erred in adjusting\n\nhis CHC upward based upon six unscored convictions for offenses\n\nhe committed prior to age 18 and based upon five unscored adult\n\nconvictions from more than 10 years before commencement of the\n\npresent offenses.15 We understand Footman to be arguing that the\n\n\n\n     15   Under U.S.S.G. §§ 4A1.2(d) and 4A1.2(e), Footman's juvenile\nconvictions and his adult convictions from more than ten years prior to\nthe present offenses (and that resulted in sentences of thirteen months\nor less) were not included in his initial CHC calculation.\n\n                                     -26-\n\fdistrict court committed an error of law by considering improper\n\nfactors in making the departure.         Our review is plenary.   See\n\nUnited States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            In an attempt to provide guidance on this issue, the\n\nSentencing Commission amended the Commentary to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2\n\nin 1992 to provide:\n\n            If the court finds that a sentence imposed outside\n            this time period is evidence of similar, or serious\n            dissimilar, criminal conduct, the court may consider\n            this information in determining whether an upward\n            departure is warranted under § 4A1.3 (Adequacy of\n            Criminal History Category).\n\nU.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 472 (amending application note 8 of the\n\ncommentary to § 4A1.2). According to the Sentencing Commission,\n\n\"[t]his amendment clarifies that dissimilar, serious prior\n\noffenses outside the applicable time period may be considered in\n\ndetermining whether an upward departure is warranted under\n\n§ 4A1.3.\"    Id.\n\n            Footman says that despite this clear guidance from the\n\nSentencing Commission, the district judge made no finding that\n\nthe six juvenile and five adult convictions upon which she based\n\nthe   upward       departure   represented   \"similar,   or   serious\n\ndissimilar, criminal conduct.\"\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\f            Footman's argument does not capture what the district\n\ncourt actually did in its careful and attentive sentencing\n\ndecision.    The court observed that Footman's offenses were, in\n\nlarge part, serious; that they escalated; and that recidivism\n\nwas characteristic.      These   were   certainly   adequate   bases,\n\npermitted by the law, to conclude that his CHC was too low.\n\nMoreover, the Guidelines Commentary on which Footman relies is\n\nexemplary, not exclusive.     For that reason, § 4A1.3 explains\n\nthat evidence of an inadequate CHC \"may include, but is not\n\nlimited to,\" specifically enumerated categories.           U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4A1.3; see also United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 26\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).    All the section actually requires is that the\n\njudge's finding that the CHC is too low be based upon \"reliable\n\ninformation.\"     U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3.     \"[A] court should not infer\n\nfrom inexplicit Guidelines language, or from language that\n\nauthorizes use of a particular factor as a basis for departure\n\nin some cases, an absolute barrier in principle against using\n\ncertain other factors as grounds for departure in other unusual\n\ncircumstances.\"    United States v. Doe, 18 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f            In addition to analyzing Footman's prior, unscored\n\nconvictions, the trial judge focused on two other sources of\n\ninformation      in    determining      whether     the   initial     CHC    was\n\nrepresentative. First, the trial judge considered Footman's own\n\nbragging about how he had beaten previous charges and his plans\n\nto \"pimp up again\" after he beat the present charges.                  Second,\n\nthe trial     judge     considered      A.M.'s    testimony      regarding   how\n\nFootman had intimidated her into not testifying against him\n\nafter he had been charged with deriving support from a minor\n\nprostitute (A.M.).          A.M. had even brought intimidation charges\n\nagainst Footman while he was in pre-trial detention for this\n\noffense and had sought a restraining order against him.                      The\n\ntrial    judge     credited     A.M.'s    testimony       that    Footman    had\n\nintimidated her into dropping her request for the restraining\n\norder and not testifying against him.\n\n            This is one area of the Guidelines where individualized\n\nattention     to      the   defendant     is     encouraged.        That     this\n\nindividualized attention worked to Footman's detriment is a\n\nfunction of his incorrigibility, not of an error by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n2. Departure Under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.4\n\n                                     -29-\n\f            Footman      separately    argues   that    a   second   upward\n\ndeparture, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5K2.4, was error because the\n\nabductions of A.M. and S.O. (the rape and beating of S.O. in\n\nNovember 1996 and the beating of A.M. in February 1997) were not\n\ncommitted    to    facilitate    the    commission     of   an   offense   of\n\nconviction.\n\n            Whether the abductions were committed to facilitate the\n\noffenses for which Footman was convicted is a question of fact.\n\nWe review the district court's fact findings at sentencing for\n\nclear error.      See United States v. Li, 206 F.3d 78, 85-86 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).       We otherwise review the district court's decision\n\nto   depart       from   the   sentencing    guidelines     for   abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.       See id.\n\n            The abductions postdate the transportation offenses\n\nforming the basis for the 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) charge, Footman\n\nargues, and so cannot be counted. Because the trial judge could\n\nreasonably conclude that the abductions did facilitate criminal\n\nconduct for which Footman was charged and convicted, we need not\n\ndecide whether an abduction that clearly postdates the criminal\n\nact for which a defendant is convicted could support a departure\n\nunder § 5K2.4.\n\n                                      -30-\n\f         Footman was charged with and convicted of conspiracy\n\nto transport women (including minors) across state lines for the\n\npurpose of prostitution from in or about June 1996 until in or\n\nabout April 1997.   The abductions occurred during this period\n\nand clearly \"facilitated\" the commission of the conspiracy. Cf.\n\nUnited States v.

Footman was convicted of one count of conspiring to transport women, including three minors, across state lines for the purpose of prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; four counts of transporting minors across state lines for the purpose of prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 2423(a); one count of transporting an adult across state lines for the purpose of prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 2421; and twelve counts of using an interstate facility to distribute the proceeds of prostitution activities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 1952(a)(1). He was tried alone, although Kimyou Tes, one of the women involved in the prostitution ring, was described as a co-conspirator.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman, ably represented by counsel, says his conviction must fall because the evidence was not sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury was not properly instructed, and some evidence -- Footman's own bragging and threatening statements in recorded telephone conversations from prison -- was improperly obtained. He also complains about the district court's sentencing that resulted, through several upward departures, in a sentence of 15 years, about twice the mandatory minimum. Counsel's arguments are not frivolous; but neither are they sufficient, and we affirm both the verdict and the sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal requires that we resolve for the first time the issue of whether the Massachusetts prison system's practice of intercepting and recording inmate telephone calls violates Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510 et. seq. (\"Title III\"). It also requires further delineation of the distinction between being a mere victim of a conspiracy and being a co-conspirator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the essential facts as a reasonable jury could have found them and in the light most favorable to the government. See United States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436, 438 (1st Cir. 1995). A fuller description of the facts may be found in the district court's sentencing opinion. See United States v. Footman, 66 F. Supp. 2d 83 (D. Mass. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman, assisted by Tes and another prostitute, Rita Boykins, ran a prostitution business that included three minors, S.O., age seventeen, A.M., age seventeen, and J-3, who was only fourteen years old.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Footman recruited S.O. from a Massachusetts state courtroom, where he told her that, in order to get back custody of her infant daughter, she would need to earn money. She went to work as a prostitute in Chinatown and gave her money to Footman. A.M. became a prostitute for Footman when she was sixteen years old and worked at the trade in Boston. J-3, the 14 year old, was trained in how to be a prostitute in 1996 by another woman in Footman's menagerie, on his instructions \"just to show her what to do and tell her it was fun.\" J-3 could not go through with her first attempt at prostitution, and one of the other prostitutes told Footman she didn't feel that J-3 was right for it. Footman urged patience, and eventually J-3 successfully worked as a prostitute. Boykins, who was an adult during the periods relevant to Footman's convictions, also worked as a prostitute for Footman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in the summer of 1996, the young women were transported to New Castle, Delaware, where they worked their trade at a truck stop and gave their earnings to Footman. They received about $10 a day for condoms and food. There were multiple trips to Delaware from late June or early July 1996 to March 1997, each trip typically lasting a few weeks. Although Footman did not always accompany the young women to Delaware, he would make appearances there for a few days at a time. Different prostitutes wired Footman the collective receipts, unless Footman was in Delaware, in which case the money was handed to him directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The June 1996 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late June or early July 1996 Footman told A.M. that they would be going to Delaware to work at a truck stop because things had gotten \"hot\" with the police in Boston. Footman drove in one car, and A.M., Tes, and other prostitutes followed behind in a second car. Footman registered for rooms at the Budget Motel near the truck stop and took the young women to the truck stop to begin working. Footman told them what to charge for different sex acts, and they gave the money they earned to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The July/August 1996 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M. and other prostitutes went to Delaware in late July or early August 1996, at Footman's direction. A.M. drove down in Footman's car with Tes. Footman did not accompany them on this trip. Tes registered the young women at the Budget Motel, listing Footman's car as their car. A.M. wired the money they made back to Footman. On one occasion, A.M. also wired money back to Tes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After they had returned to Massachusetts, A.M. attempted to leave Footman. Footman responded by dragging A.M. out of her house into the backyard, beating her, and throwing her over a fence. He then forced her into a car driven by Tes and took the money she had made working for an escort service. They eventually ended up at Boykins's apartment, where Footman explained that things would be the \"old way\" --that A.M. would stay where Footman put her, would not have a boyfriend, would not speak to other pimps, and would give Footman all the money she made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The October 1996 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M., J-3, Tes, and other prostitutes drove to Delaware in October 1996. A.M. testified that they drove in Footman's car, but Boykins, who arrived later by bus, registered for rooms at the Budget Motel and listed Tes's Chevy Celebrity as the car they were driving.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Footman had told Boykins that the police weren't so bad in Delaware.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The night before A.M.'s birthday, Footman drove S.O. and another prostitute down to Delaware and dropped S.O. off. As he had previously done with A.M., Footman had told S.O. that things were \"hot\" in Boston with the police and that they would be going to Delaware to work at a truck stop. At Footman's direction, A.M. wired Footman the money she and the other young women had earned from prostitution. Boykins also wired money to Footman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the date is not clear from the record, at some point A.M. and J-3, at Footman's direction, traveled by bus to Delaware to work at the truck stop. Footman paid for the bus tickets, and A.M. gave the money they made to Footman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The November 1996 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M., J-3, Tes, and other prostitutes traveled to Delaware in November 1996. Footman, Tes, and Boykins registered for rooms for different dates during the period from November 3 to December 16, 1996. A.M., Tes, and Boykins wired money to Footman during this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time in November, while in Delaware, S.O. tried to escape from Footman. At one point she was chased down by Tes and Footman, with Tes driving the car. Footman brought S.O. to a motel room and brutally beat and raped her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The January 1997 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M. and other prostitutes drove to Delaware again in January 1997. A.M. wired Footman the money they made from prostitution. Boykins also wired money to Footman from Delaware in January 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M. left Delaware for about a month, traveling \"down south\" with a truck driver. When she returned to Delaware in February, she attempted to leave Footman to go to work for another pimp. When Footman found out, he beat A.M. She again agreed to work for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The March 1997 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boykins drove to Delaware with Footman in March 1997 and worked at the truck stop as a prostitute. They traveled in Footman's car, and Footman registered for the motel rooms. Recorded CB transmissions from March 14, 1997, show Boykins directing prostitution at the Delaware truck stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman makes several arguments that the government's evidence was insufficient. The arguments require a careful roadmap of the counts of conviction. In addition to conspiracy (count one of the indictment), Footman was convicted of five separate substantive transportation offenses (counts three through seven of the indictment). Specifically, he was convicted on count three (transportation of A.M. in or about late July 1996, to in or about early August 1996); count four (transportation of A.M. in or about October 1996); count five (transportation of S.O. in or about October 1996); count six (transportation of J-3 in or about October 1996 and November 1996); and count seven (transportation of Boykins in or about March 1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In reviewing Footman's sufficiency claims, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all legitimate inferences and resolving all credibility conflicts in its favor. See United States v. Sabatino, 943 F.2d 94, 97 (1st Cir. 1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Conspiracy (Count One)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman argues, correctly, that a conspiracy of one person is no conspiracy at all. The government had charged him with conspiring with Kimyou Tes, one of the prostitutes, to transport adults and three minors across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. But Tes was never tried and the charges against her were dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Footman says Tes was a mere victim and that a woman who simply prostitutes herself under the control of a pimp and consents to being transported across state lines cannot be a co-conspirator under the Mann Act. There is law to this effect. See Gebardi v. United States, 287 U.S. 112, 123 (1932) (\"[W]e perceive in the failure of the Mann Act to condemn the woman's participation in those transportations which are effected with her mere consent, evidence of an affirmative legislative policy to leave her acquiescence unpunished.\"). Specifically, Footman argues that there was insufficient evidence that Tes ever entered any agreement with him to accomplish the goals of the conspiracy. See United States v. Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d 210, 226 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of the conclusion that \"Tes was a mere victim,\" Footman relies most heavily on statements made by the trial judge at sentencing. The judge said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, none of the women, with exception of Tes, was included in the indictment. Plainly, the indictment and the proof offered by the government, characterized the women and girls instead as victims, not participants. Everything I heard confirms this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, although Tes was originally included in the indictment with Footm[a]n, charges against her were subsequently dismissed. Nothing I heard in the trial, or read in the parties' submissions persuades me that Tes was in a different category than the other women or girls. Thus, I find that there were no \"participants\" involved with Footman in these crimes.... Footman, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument based on the district judge's comments at sentencing is largely beside the point. The question of guilt was for the jury to decide, and to focus on what the trial judge said is to focus on the wrong actor at trial. See United States v. Pitocchelli, 830 F.2d 401, 403 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real question is whether the jury had adequate evidence to conclude that Tes was more than a victim -- that she was in fact a co-conspirator. The dividing line is an important one. There is an inherent policy judgment in the Mann Act not to prosecute women who do no more than consent to being transported across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. But that policy simply does not apply when the women assume roles in running the business. Thus, in Sabatino this court upheld the conspiracy conviction of a wife who played an active role in two prostitution businesses her husband ran: an \"escort service\" and a \"health club.\" Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 97-98; see also United States v. Anderson, 139 F.3d 291, 295-96, 298-99 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming, in an appeal based upon other grounds, conviction of an adult prostitute for transporting a minor where the adult prostitute's car was used in transportation and where the adult prostitute purchased a train ticket for the minor). Footman says there is no evidence that Tes was a partner, received any income, made any agreements, or committed any acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. There was no evidence, he says, that she acted any differently from the others who were under his dominion and thrall. In particular, Footman says that the other prostitutes also registered for rooms and sent money back to him, as Tes did, and so she is indistinguishable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that many of Tes's actions were of the same nature as the actions of some of the other prostitutes. That is not the crux; the issue is whether she agreed to further the conspiracy and took steps to do so, beyond her working as a prostitute herself and crossing state lines. There is ample evidence from which a jury could conclude that she acted as Footman's agent and co-conspirator. Tes, who lived with Footman, acted on Footman's behalf as transporter of the women, arranger of the details of the business, occasional money handler, and enforcer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tes transported A.M. and J-3 to Delaware. She registered for dozens of nights of stays by the group at motels in Massachusetts and Delaware. This was far in excess of the number of room registrations by the others. Importantly, unlike most of the other prostitutes, Tes had a driver's license and an ID. Footman himself did not have a driver's license until February of 1997. The license was important to the transportation scheme of driving the women to Delaware. A driver with a license was needed to continue the trip if they were stopped by the police. In addition, Tes owned (or, at least, allowed to be registered in her name) two of the automobiles used for transportation -- a Chevy Celebrity and a Chrysler LeBaron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Tes acted as an enforcer. When A.M. attempted to free herself from Footman's control in September 1996, Tes assisted Footman in coercing her back into his employ. She also chased down S.O. in a motel parking lot in Delaware when S.O. was attempting to escape from Footman. This evidence, in the aggregate, was adequate to support the finding that Tes had agreed to the criminal scheme and had committed overt acts in furtherance of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Substantive Counts Three, Four, and Seven</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman also argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he transported A.M. (counts three and four) or Boykins (count seven) across state lines for the purpose of prostitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to A.M.'s several trips to Delaware, Footman says there is no evidence that he went with her or arranged for anyone else to transport her. But the evidence supports a finding that Tes was Footman's agent in transporting A.M. A.M. testified that she and other prostitutes went to Delaware in late July, with Tes, at Footman's direction. The women traveled in Footman's car, and Tes registered for the motel rooms. A.M. wired money back to both Footman and Tes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M. testified that she, J-3, and other prostitutes drove to Delaware with Tes in October 1996. The record evidence is that the group drove down either in Footman's car or in Tes's car. Moreover, not long before this trip, Footman had beaten A.M., thrown her over a backyard fence, taken the money she earned working for an escort service, and told her that, from then on, she would stay where Footman put her and would give him all the money she made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Boykins, she testified that Footman traveled with her to Delaware in March 1997. Footman says there is no evidence that he exercised any control over her or that she went to engage in prostitution. The trip was made in his car, and he registered for the rooms at the motel. Boykins had prostituted for Footman in Delaware before this trip. A jury could easily infer that this trip was for similar purposes. Indeed, recorded CB transmissions show she was directing prostitution at the Delaware truck stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Overall, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman's argument that the jury instructions were legally erroneous is pertinent to his convictions on the substantive transportation counts. Our review is de novo. See United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 68 (1st Cir. 1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman was charged under two theories -- that he was a direct participant in the Mann Act violations and that he was an aider and abettor. Each theory has somewhat different requirements. For example, the direct theory under &#167;&#167; 2421 and 2423(a) requires that Footman \"knowingly transport[ed]\" the women across state lines. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2421, 2423(a). The statutory language does not literally extend to \"causing\" the transportation. See Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 99. Under the aiding and abetting theory, by contrast, it would suffice that Footman \"caused\" the women to be transported across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge initially explained to the jury that it could convict Footman under either a direct participation theory or an aider and abettor theory. She then defined \"transport\" under &#167; 2421 as \"to move or carry or cause someone to be moved or carried from one state to another.\" Moments later, the judge defined \"knowing transportation\" to include \"cause to be transported.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge then went on to instruct that the &#167; 2423(a) counts required proof of the same elements as &#167; 2421, with the additional element that \"the transportation needs to involve a minor.\" In giving the &#167; 2423(a) instruction, the judge distinguished liability under the direct participant theory from liability for aiding and abetting. The instruction was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, then, to the two elements that I have described, that the defendant did knowingly transport or did counsel, command, induce, procure or cause the transportation of an individual, a named individual, in interstate commerce - - that's what I've summarized as the knowing transportation or causing to transport prong; two, that the defendant did so with the intent that the individual engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman claims that the judge's instructions allowed the jury to convict Footman \"for conduct that was not criminalized by &#167;&#167; 2421 and 2423(a).\" This argument is to no avail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The trial judge properly instructed the jury on the difference between direct participation liability and liability as an aider and abettor. Any confusion generated by the judge's having defined \"knowing transportation\" under &#167; 2421 to include \"cause to be transported\" was corrected by her proper instruction regarding &#167; 2423(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the earlier instructions defining \"knowing transportation\" were in error, there was no prejudice to Footman, as there is no \"pure\" theory of direct liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> \"[A]n aider and abettor charge is implicit in all indictments for substantive offenses, so it need not be specifically pleaded for an aiding and abetting conviction to be returned.\" Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 99-100. As the revisor's note to &#167; 2 states, \"one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal enterprise... is guilty as a principal even though he intentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the completed offense.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 revisor's note. When aiding and abetting is involved, then, the \"counsels, commands, induces, or procures\" and \"cause\" language from &#167; 2 is properly part of the jury's instruction. Cf. United States v. Leppo, 177 F.3d 93, 95 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 501 (1999) (harmless error for trial judge to include \"willfully causes\" language from &#167; 2(b) as part of definition of \"transport\" under statute criminalizing \"transport[]\" of stolen goods).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Admission of Footman's Recorded Telephone Calls</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court admitted evidence in the form of recordings of telephone calls Footman made from prison to Tes and others. In those calls, Footman described himself as a pimp, threatened the women with harm if they revealed any information, and made statements that supported the government's version of the facts. Footman says these calls were recorded in violation of Title III and that they should have been excluded as evidence. We review the district court's fact findings for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo. See United States v. Beras, 183 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the state prison in Concord, Massachusetts, all inmate calls, except calls to designated attorneys, are recorded and subject to monitoring. See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 103, &#167; 482. In order to use the phones, inmates are required to sign a form stating that they understand that their calls will be monitored and recorded. Large stickers on the phones remind inmates that their calls are being recorded. A third notice comes at the start of each call, when a pre-recorded message tells both parties to the call that \"[a]ll call detail and conversation, excluding approved attorney calls, will be recorded.\" Footman's calls were made in this context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In civil prison conditions cases, this court has alluded to but not decided the issue of whether the interception (and recording) of inmate calls violates Title III. See Gilday v. Dubois, 124 F.3d 277, 296-98 (1st Cir. 1997); Langton v. Hogan, 71 F.3d. 930, 935-37 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced the calls on the theory that they were consensual and so admissible under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(2)(c), which refers to \"prior consent to such interception.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The government claimed that there was valid consent from both parties to the telephone calls. Footman had signed the form giving his consent to recording as a condition of making the calls, and, the argument went, the recipients of the calls consented by accepting the calls after listening to the recorded warning that the calls could be recorded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled law that only one party need consent to the interception of the calls. See United States v. Pratt, 913 F.2d 982, 986-87 (1st Cir. 1990). The district court held that the recipient's consent was valid, but that the consent of the prisoner was not. See United States v. Footman, 33 F. Supp. 2d 60, 64 (D. Mass. 1998). The result -- that there was a valid consent -- is correct, but our reasoning is different. In our view, the consent of the prisoner is valid and there is no need to go further. We do not reach the question of whether the other party to the call consented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of consent, either express or implied, may vary with the circumstances of the parties. See Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 116-17 (1st Cir. 1990). Footman does not make a Fourth Amendment argument, but raises a statutory question under Title III. Here, Footman expressly acknowledged his understanding that his use of the prison telephones was conditioned on his calls being monitored and recorded. Even express consents, though, may be treated as invalid under some circumstances, such as where they result from overriding coercion. See 2 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure &#167;4.3(c), at 361 n.87 (2d ed. 1999). In Langton, this court questioned whether consent could be premised upon an inmate's having to choose between making no phone calls and agreeing to have his phone calls recorded. See 71 F.3d at 936. Footman argues that this is the position he was in, and that it is Kafkaesque to say his consent was voluntary. Footman urges that the government may not \"condition access to even a gratuitous benefit or privilege it bestows upon the sacrifice of a constitutional right.\" Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 568 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In literal terms, Blackburn -- which involved consent to strip searches and thus violations of bodily integrity -- does not apply here. Prisoners have no per se constitutional right to use a telephone, and the violation urged here is of a statute, not the Constitution. Nonetheless, the argument by analogy must still be addressed as to whether extracting consent as a condition of access to a telephone call by a prisoner means the consent is not voluntary, and so is invalid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the merits of that argument outside of the prison context, where privacy interests are stronger,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> it has little force when the person giving consent is in confinement. Prison inmates have few expectations of privacy in their communications. Cf. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-28 (1984). There is no reason to think that Congress would not have included within the meaning of consent a prison inmate's express acceptance of having his calls recorded as a condition of using the telephone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> This is particularly so given the \"deference and flexibility\" federal courts afford state officials in managing prisons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 482 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have reached this same conclusion -- that prison inmates in Footman's position have given their consent for purposes of Title III. See United States v. Workman, 80 F.3d 688, 692-94 (2d Cir. 1996); United States v. Van Poyck, 77 F.3d 285, 292 (9th Cir. 1996); United States v. Horr, 963 F.2d 1124, 1126 (8th Cir. 1992). But see United States v. Daniels, 902 F.2d 1238, 1244-45 (7th Cir. 1990) (expressing reservations about finding Title III's consent requirement satisfied in this context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no violation of Title III and no error in admitting the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman argues that the district court erred in departing upward under two provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines in determining his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court departed upward, at the government's request, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 on the ground that Footman's Criminal History Category (CHC) of III did not \"adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 Footman's adjusted CHC was VI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman says that the district court erred in adjusting his CHC upward based upon six unscored convictions for offenses he committed prior to age 18 and based upon five unscored adult convictions from more than 10 years before commencement of the present offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> We understand Footman to be arguing that the district court committed an error of law by considering improper factors in making the departure. Our review is plenary. See United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to provide guidance on this issue, the Sentencing Commission amended the Commentary to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2 in 1992 to provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court finds that a sentence imposed outside this time period is evidence of similar, or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct, the court may consider this information in determining whether an upward departure is warranted under &#167; 4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 472 (amending application note 8 of the commentary to &#167; 4A1.2). According to the Sentencing Commission, \"[t]his amendment clarifies that dissimilar, serious prior offenses outside the applicable time period may be considered in determining whether an upward departure is warranted under &#167; 4A1.3.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman says that despite this clear guidance from the Sentencing Commission, the district judge made no finding that the six juvenile and five adult convictions upon which she based the upward departure represented \"similar, or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman's argument does not capture what the district court actually did in its careful and attentive sentencing decision. The court observed that Footman's offenses were, in large part, serious; that they escalated; and that recidivism was characteristic. These were certainly adequate bases, permitted by the law, to conclude that his CHC was too low. Moreover, the Guidelines Commentary on which Footman relies is exemplary, not exclusive. For that reason, &#167; 4A1.3 explains that evidence of an inadequate CHC \"may include, but is not limited to,\" specifically enumerated categories. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3; see also United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1997). All the section actually requires is that the judge's finding that the CHC is too low be based upon \"reliable information.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. \"[A] court should not infer from inexplicit Guidelines language, or from language that authorizes use of a particular factor as a basis for departure in some cases, an absolute barrier in principle against using certain other factors as grounds for departure in other unusual circumstances.\" United States v. Doe, 18 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to analyzing Footman's prior, unscored convictions, the trial judge focused on two other sources of information in determining whether the initial CHC was representative. First, the trial judge considered Footman's own bragging about how he had beaten previous charges and his plans to \"pimp up again\" after he beat the present charges. Second, the trial judge considered A.M.'s testimony regarding how Footman had intimidated her into not testifying against him after he had been charged with deriving support from a minor prostitute (A.M.). A.M. had even brought intimidation charges against Footman while he was in pre-trial detention for this offense and had sought a restraining order against him. The trial judge credited A.M.'s testimony that Footman had intimidated her into dropping her request for the restraining order and not testifying against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is one area of the Guidelines where individualized attention to the defendant is encouraged. That this individualized attention worked to Footman's detriment is a function of his incorrigibility, not of an error by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Departure Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.4</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman separately argues that a second upward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.4, was error because the abductions of A.M. and S.O. (the rape and beating of S.O. in November 1996 and the beating of A.M. in February 1997) were not committed to facilitate the commission of an offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the abductions were committed to facilitate the offenses for which Footman was convicted is a question of fact. We review the district court's fact findings at sentencing for clear error. See United States v. Li, 206 F.3d 78, 85-86 (1st Cir. 2000). We otherwise review the district court's decision to depart from the sentencing guidelines for abuse of discretion. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abductions postdate the transportation offenses forming the basis for the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(a) charge, Footman argues, and so cannot be counted. Because the trial judge could reasonably conclude that the abductions did facilitate criminal conduct for which Footman was charged and convicted, we need not decide whether an abduction that clearly postdates the criminal act for which a defendant is convicted could support a departure under &#167; 5K2.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman was charged with and convicted of conspiracy to transport women (including minors) across state lines for the purpose of prostitution from in or about June 1996 until in or about April 1997. The abductions occurred during this period and clearly \"facilitated\" the commission of the conspiracy. Cf. United States v. Uccio, 940 F.2d 753, 760 (2d Cir. 1991) (affirming &#167; 5K2.4 departure for kidnaping and assault of coconspirator). Further, Footman was charged with and convicted of a substantive transportation offense that occurred in March 1997. Because the abductions occurred prior to the commencement of that offense, the trial judge could reasonably conclude that they facilitated that offense. Footman did not commit either of the acts in private. The record evidence is more than sufficient to have allowed the trial judge to conclude that Footman carried out these attacks in front of other prostitutes in order to send a message. The district court committed no abuse of discretion in deciding to depart upward on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm Footman's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The government originally charged Tes with conspiracy and charged her under a number of the substantive offense counts but dropped the charges after Footman was convicted.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Footman has also filed a pro se brief, raising arguments that have no merit.

United States v. Upham, 168 F.3d 532, 537 (1st Cir. 1999).

The government's reasons, whether admirable, tactical, or cynical, were the stuff of prosecutorial discretion and do not raise any additional issues for consideration on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  The government argues that Footman failed to object to the district court's final instructions and that, as a result, our review is for plain error.

That last instruction was a correct statement of the law, and it clearly articulated the elements for both the direct participation and the aiding and abetting theories of criminal liability. We assume Footman's argument that the trial judge committed error is really in response to her having defined \"knowing transportation,\" on a number of occasions, to include \"cause to be transported.\" These statements did not correctly describe the elements of &#167; 2421. As already noted, \"transport\" in &#167; 2421 does not include \"causing\" the transportation of an individual. See Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 99.</p>\n        <p>Footman may also be claiming that it was improper to instruct the jury on aiding and abetting liability at all. If so, this argument is without merit. Footman was charged under both the substantive statutory sections and the aiding and abetting statute, and the evidence put on by the government sufficed to allow the issue to go to the jury.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  A different situation might arise in a case where the prosecution's theory was that the defendant \"caused\" the prostitute to transport herself across state lines by persuading her to do so, whether by sweet talk, for a bonus, or the like. In such a case, the question of whether the \"causation\" involved would suffice to constitute knowing transportation under the substantive statutory sections is a real question. That was not the evidence or the government's theory here, and so we do not need to explore this nuanced meaning of the phrase \"knowingly transport.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p>  The government had another theory of admissibility: that the calls were placed on telephone equipment being used in the ordinary course of their duties by investigative or law enforcement officers.

She went to work as a prostitute in Chinatown and gave her money to Footman. A.M. became a prostitute for Footman when she was sixteen years old and worked at the trade in Boston. J-3, the 14 year old, was trained in how to be a prostitute in 1996 by another woman in Footman's menagerie, on his instructions \"just to show her what to do and tell her it was fun.\" J-3 could not go through with her first attempt at prostitution, and one of the other prostitutes told Footman she didn't feel that J-3 was right for it. Footman urged patience, and eventually J-3 successfully worked as a prostitute. Boykins, who was an adult during the periods relevant to Footman's convictions, also worked as a prostitute for Footman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in the summer of 1996, the young women were transported to New Castle, Delaware, where they worked their trade at a truck stop and gave their earnings to Footman. They received about $10 a day for condoms and food. There were multiple trips to Delaware from late June or early July 1996 to March 1997, each trip typically lasting a few weeks. Although Footman did not always accompany the young women to Delaware, he would make appearances there for a few days at a time. Different prostitutes wired Footman the collective receipts, unless Footman was in Delaware, in which case the money was handed to him directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The June 1996 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late June or early July 1996 Footman told A.M. that they would be going to Delaware to work at a truck stop because things had gotten \"hot\" with the police in Boston. Footman drove in one car, and A.M., Tes, and other prostitutes followed behind in a second car. Footman registered for rooms at the Budget Motel near the truck stop and took the young women to the truck stop to begin working. Footman told them what to charge for different sex acts, and they gave the money they earned to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The July/August 1996 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M. and other prostitutes went to Delaware in late July or early August 1996, at Footman's direction. A.M. drove down in Footman's car with Tes. Footman did not accompany them on this trip. Tes registered the young women at the Budget Motel, listing Footman's car as their car. A.M. wired the money they made back to Footman. On one occasion, A.M. also wired money back to Tes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After they had returned to Massachusetts, A.M. attempted to leave Footman. Footman responded by dragging A.M. out of her house into the backyard, beating her, and throwing her over a fence. He then forced her into a car driven by Tes and took the money she had made working for an escort service. They eventually ended up at Boykins's apartment, where Footman explained that things would be the \"old way\" --that A.M. would stay where Footman put her, would not have a boyfriend, would not speak to other pimps, and would give Footman all the money she made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The October 1996 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M., J-3, Tes, and other prostitutes drove to Delaware in October 1996. A.M. testified that they drove in Footman's car, but Boykins, who arrived later by bus, registered for rooms at the Budget Motel and listed Tes's Chevy Celebrity as the car they were driving.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Footman had told Boykins that the police weren't so bad in Delaware.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The night before A.M.'s birthday, Footman drove S.O. and another prostitute down to Delaware and dropped S.O. off. As he had previously done with A.M., Footman had told S.O. that things were \"hot\" in Boston with the police and that they would be going to Delaware to work at a truck stop. At Footman's direction, A.M. wired Footman the money she and the other young women had earned from prostitution. Boykins also wired money to Footman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the date is not clear from the record, at some point A.M. and J-3, at Footman's direction, traveled by bus to Delaware to work at the truck stop. Footman paid for the bus tickets, and A.M. gave the money they made to Footman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The November 1996 Trip</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M., J-3, Tes, and other prostitutes traveled to Delaware in November 1996. Footman, Tes, and Boykins registered for rooms for different dates during the period from November 3 to December 16, 1996. A.M., Tes, and Boykins wired money to Footman during this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time in November, while in Delaware, S.O. tried to escape from Footman.

When she returned to Delaware in February, she attempted to leave Footman to go to work for another pimp. When Footman found out, he beat A.M.

Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman makes several arguments that the government's evidence was insufficient. The arguments require a careful roadmap of the counts of conviction. In addition to conspiracy (count one of the indictment), Footman was convicted of five separate substantive transportation offenses (counts three through seven of the indictment). Specifically, he was convicted on count three (transportation of A.M. in or about late July 1996, to in or about early August 1996); count four (transportation of A.M. in or about October 1996); count five (transportation of S.O. in or about October 1996); count six (transportation of J-3 in or about October 1996 and November 1996); and count seven (transportation of Boykins in or about March 1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In reviewing Footman's sufficiency claims, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all legitimate inferences and resolving all credibility conflicts in its favor. See United States v. Sabatino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567584\"><a href=\"/opinion/567584/united-states-v-diane-sabatino-united-states-of-america-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 97 (1st Cir. 1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Conspiracy (Count One)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman argues, correctly, that a conspiracy of one person is no conspiracy at all. The government had charged him with conspiring with Kimyou Tes, one of the prostitutes, to transport adults and three minors across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. But Tes was never tried and the charges against her were dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Footman says Tes was a mere victim and that a woman who simply prostitutes herself under the control of a pimp and consents to being transported across state lines cannot be a co-conspirator under the Mann Act. There is law to this effect. See Gebardi v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101962\"><a href=\"/opinion/101962/gebardi-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 123 (1932) (\"[W]e perceive in the failure of the Mann Act to condemn the woman's participation in those transportations which are effected with her mere consent, evidence of an affirmative legislative policy to leave her acquiescence unpunished.\"). Specifically, Footman argues that there was insufficient evidence that Tes ever entered any agreement with him to accomplish the goals of the conspiracy. See United States v. Colon-Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198655\"><a href=\"/opinion/198655/united-states-v-colon-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 226 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of the conclusion that \"Tes was a mere victim,\" Footman relies most heavily on statements made by the trial judge at sentencing. The judge said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, none of the women, with exception of Tes, was included in the indictment. Plainly, the indictment and the proof offered by the government, characterized the women and girls instead as victims, not participants. Everything I heard confirms this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, although Tes was originally included in the indictment with Footm[a]n, charges against her were subsequently dismissed. Nothing I heard in the trial, or read in the parties' submissions persuades me that Tes was in a different category than the other women or girls. Thus, I find that there were no \"participants\" involved with Footman in these crimes.... <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2489017\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Footman,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2489017/united-states-v-footman/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument based on the district judge's comments at sentencing is largely beside the point. The question of guilt was for the jury to decide, and to focus on what the trial judge said is to focus on the wrong actor at trial. See United States v. Pitocchelli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495223\"><a href=\"/opinion/495223/united-states-v-ronald-j-pitocchelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 403 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real question is whether the jury had adequate evidence to conclude that Tes was more than a victim -- that she was in fact a co-conspirator. The dividing line is an important one. There is an inherent policy judgment in the Mann Act not to prosecute women who do no more than consent to being transported across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. But that policy simply does not apply when the women assume roles in running the business. Thus, in Sabatino this court upheld the conspiracy conviction of a wife who played an active role in two prostitution businesses her husband ran: an \"escort service\" and a \"health club.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567584\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sabatino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/567584/united-states-v-diane-sabatino-united-states-of-america-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">97-98</span></a></span>; see also United States v. Anderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197872\"><a href=\"/opinion/197872/united-states-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 295-96, 298-99 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming, in an appeal based upon other grounds, conviction of an adult prostitute for transporting a minor where the adult prostitute's car was used in transportation and where the adult prostitute purchased a train ticket for the minor). Footman says there is no evidence that Tes was a partner, received any income, made any agreements, or committed any acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. There was no evidence, he says, that she acted any differently from the others who were under his dominion and thrall. In particular, Footman says that the other prostitutes also registered for rooms and sent money back to him, as Tes did, and so she is indistinguishable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that many of Tes's actions were of the same nature as the actions of some of the other prostitutes. That is not the crux; the issue is whether she agreed to further the conspiracy and took steps to do so, beyond her working as a prostitute herself and crossing state lines. There is ample evidence from which a jury could conclude that she acted as Footman's agent and co-conspirator. Tes, who lived with Footman, acted on Footman's behalf as transporter of the women, arranger of the details of the business, occasional money handler, and enforcer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tes transported A.M. and J-3 to Delaware. She registered for dozens of nights of stays by the group at motels in Massachusetts and Delaware. This was far in excess of the number of room registrations by the others. Importantly, unlike most of the other prostitutes, Tes had a driver's license and an <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197872\"><a href=\"/opinion/197872/united-states-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"id_token\">ID.</span> Footman himself </a></span>did not have a driver's license until February of 1997. The license was important to the transportation scheme of driving the women to Delaware. A driver with a license was needed to continue the trip if they were stopped by the police. In addition, Tes owned (or, at least, allowed to be registered in her name) two of the automobiles used for transportation -- a Chevy Celebrity and a Chrysler LeBaron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Tes acted as an enforcer. When A.M. attempted to free herself from Footman's control in September 1996, Tes assisted Footman in coercing her back into his employ. She also chased down S.O. in a motel parking lot in Delaware when S.O. was attempting to escape from Footman. This evidence, in the aggregate, was adequate to support the finding that Tes had agreed to the criminal scheme and had committed overt acts in furtherance of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Substantive Counts Three, Four, and Seven</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman also argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he transported A.M. (counts three and four) or Boykins (count seven) across state lines for the purpose of prostitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to A.M.'s several trips to Delaware, Footman says there is no evidence that he went with her or arranged for anyone else to transport her. But the evidence supports a finding that Tes was Footman's agent in transporting A.M. A.M. testified that she and other prostitutes went to Delaware in late July, with Tes, at Footman's direction. The women traveled in Footman's car, and Tes registered for the motel rooms. A.M. wired money back to both Footman and Tes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.M. testified that she, J-3, and other prostitutes drove to Delaware with Tes in October 1996. The record evidence is that the group drove down either in Footman's car or in Tes's car. Moreover, not long before this trip, Footman had beaten A.M., thrown her over a backyard fence, taken the money she earned working for an escort service, and told her that, from then on, she would stay where Footman put her and would give him all the money she made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Boykins, she testified that Footman traveled with her to Delaware in March 1997. Footman says there is no evidence that he exercised any control over her or that she went to engage in prostitution. The trip was made in his car, and he registered for the rooms at the motel. Boykins had prostituted for Footman in Delaware before this trip. A jury could easily infer that this trip was for similar purposes. Indeed, recorded CB transmissions show she was directing prostitution at the Delaware truck stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Overall, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman's argument that the jury instructions were legally erroneous is pertinent to his convictions on the substantive transportation counts. Our review is de novo. See United States v. Woodward, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198059\"><a href=\"/opinion/198059/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir. 1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman was charged under two theories -- that he was a direct participant in the Mann Act violations and that he was an aider and abettor. Each theory has somewhat different requirements. For example, the direct theory under &#167;&#167; 2421 and 2423(a) requires that Footman \"knowingly transport[ed]\" the women across state lines. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2421, 2423(a). The statutory language does not literally extend to \"causing\" the transportation. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567584\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sabatino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/567584/united-states-v-diane-sabatino-united-states-of-america-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>. Under the aiding and abetting theory, by contrast, it would suffice that Footman \"caused\" the women to be transported across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge initially explained to the jury that it could convict Footman under either a direct participation theory or an aider and abettor theory.

In those calls, Footman described himself as a pimp, threatened the women with harm if they revealed any information, and made statements that supported the government's version of the facts. Footman says these calls were recorded in violation of Title III and that they should have been excluded as evidence. We review the district court's fact findings for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo. See United States v.

See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 103, &#167; 482. In order to use the phones, inmates are required to sign a form stating that they understand that their calls will be monitored and recorded. Large stickers on the phones remind inmates that their calls are being recorded. A third notice comes at the start of each call, when a pre-recorded message tells both parties to the call that \"[a]ll call detail and conversation, excluding approved attorney calls, will be recorded.\" Footman's calls were made in this context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In civil prison conditions cases, this court has alluded to but not decided the issue of whether the interception (and recording) of inmate calls violates Title III.

Footman had signed the form giving his consent to recording as a condition of making the calls, and, the argument went, the recipients of the calls consented by accepting the calls after listening to the recorded warning that the calls could be recorded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled law that only one party need consent to the interception of the calls.

The district court held that the recipient's consent was valid, but that the consent of the prisoner was not. See United States v. Footman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2519132\"><a href=\"/opinion/2519132/united-states-v-footman/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 64 (D. Mass. 1998). The result -- that there was a valid consent -- is correct, but our reasoning is different. In our view, the consent of the prisoner is valid and there is no need to go further. We do not reach the question of whether the other party to the call consented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of consent, either express or implied, may vary with the circumstances of the parties. See Griggs-Ryan v.

Footman does not make a Fourth Amendment argument, but raises a statutory question under Title III. Here, Footman expressly acknowledged his understanding that his use of the prison telephones was conditioned on his calls being monitored and recorded. Even express consents, though, may be treated as invalid under some circumstances, such as where they result from overriding coercion. See 2 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure &#167;4.3(c), at 361 n.87 (2d ed. 1999). In Langton, this court questioned whether consent could be premised upon an inmate's having to choose between making no phone calls and agreeing to have his phone calls recorded. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">936</span></span>. Footman argues that this is the position he was in, and that it is Kafkaesque to say his consent was voluntary. Footman urges that the government may not \"condition access to even a gratuitous benefit or privilege it bestows upon the sacrifice of a constitutional right.\" Blackburn v. Snow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457687\"><a href=\"/opinion/457687/ruth-blackburn-v-linwood-snow/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In literal terms, Blackburn -- which involved consent to strip searches and thus violations of bodily integrity -- does not apply here. Prisoners have no per se constitutional right to use a telephone, and the violation urged here is of a statute, not the Constitution. Nonetheless, the argument by analogy must still be addressed as to whether extracting consent as a condition of access to a telephone call by a prisoner means the consent is not voluntary, and so is invalid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the merits of that argument outside of the prison context, where privacy interests are stronger,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> it has little force when the person giving consent is in confinement. Prison inmates have few expectations of privacy in their communications. Cf. Hudson v.

Our review is plenary. See United States v.

The court observed that Footman's offenses were, in large part, serious; that they escalated; and that recidivism was characteristic. These were certainly adequate bases, permitted by the law, to conclude that his CHC was too low. Moreover, the Guidelines Commentary on which Footman relies is exemplary, not exclusive. For that reason, &#167; 4A1.3 explains that evidence of an inadequate CHC \"may include, but is not limited to,\" specifically enumerated categories. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3; see also United States v. Brewster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1997). All the section actually requires is that the judge's finding that the CHC is too low be based upon \"reliable information.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. \"[A] court should not infer from inexplicit Guidelines language, or from language that authorizes use of a particular factor as a basis for departure in some cases, an absolute barrier in principle against using certain other factors as grounds for departure in other unusual circumstances.\" United States v. Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195243\"><a href=\"/opinion/195243/united-states-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to analyzing Footman's prior, unscored convictions, the trial judge focused on two other sources of information in determining whether the initial CHC was representative. First, the trial judge considered Footman's own bragging about how he had beaten previous charges and his plans to \"pimp up again\" after he beat the present charges. Second, the trial judge considered A.M.'s testimony regarding how Footman had intimidated her into not testifying against him after he had been charged with deriving support from a minor prostitute (A.M.). A.M. had even brought intimidation charges against Footman while he was in pre-trial detention for this offense and had sought a restraining order against him. The trial judge credited A.M.'s testimony that Footman had intimidated her into dropping her request for the restraining order and not testifying against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is one area of the Guidelines where individualized attention to the defendant is encouraged. That this individualized attention worked to Footman's detriment is a function of his incorrigibility, not of an error by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Departure Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.4</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman separately argues that a second upward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.4, was error because the abductions of A.M. and S.O. (the rape and beating of S.O. in November 1996 and the beating of A.M. in February 1997) were not committed to facilitate the commission of an offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the abductions were committed to facilitate the offenses for which Footman was convicted is a question of fact. We review the district court's fact findings at sentencing for clear error. See United States v. Li, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767956\"><a href=\"/opinion/767956/united-states-v-nai-fook-li-united-states-v-yiu-ming-kwan-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 85-86 (1st Cir. 2000). We otherwise review the district court's decision to depart from the sentencing guidelines for abuse of discretion. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abductions postdate the transportation offenses forming the basis for the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(a) charge, Footman argues, and so cannot be counted. Because the trial judge could reasonably conclude that the abductions did facilitate criminal conduct for which Footman was charged and convicted, we need not decide whether an abduction that clearly postdates the criminal act for which a defendant is convicted could support a departure under &#167; 5K2.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Footman was charged with and convicted of conspiracy to transport women (including minors) across state lines for the purpose of prostitution from in or about June 1996 until in or about April 1997. The abductions occurred during this period and clearly \"facilitated\" the commission of the conspiracy. Cf. United States v. Uccio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566003\"><a href=\"/opinion/566003/united-states-v-nicholas-uccio/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>, 760 (2d Cir. 1991) (affirming &#167; 5K2.4 departure for kidnaping and assault of coconspirator). Further, Footman was charged with and convicted of a substantive transportation offense that occurred in March 1997. Because the abductions occurred prior to the commencement of that offense, the trial judge could reasonably conclude that they facilitated that offense. Footman did not commit either of the acts in private. The record evidence is more than sufficient to have allowed the trial judge to conclude that Footman carried out these attacks in front of other prostitutes in order to send a message. The district court committed no abuse of discretion in deciding to depart upward on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm Footman's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The government originally charged Tes with conspiracy and charged her under a number of the substantive offense counts but dropped the charges after Footman was convicted.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Footman has also filed a pro se brief, raising arguments that have no merit.

Because we are able to affirm Footman's convictions under the standard less burdensome to Footman, we do not address the issue of whether Footman adequately preserved these claims for appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  Footman also complains about the government's \"cynical\" tactics in naming Tes as a co-conspirator and then dismissing the charges against her. The government's reasons, whether admirable, tactical, or cynical, were the stuff of prosecutorial discretion and do not raise any additional issues for consideration on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  The government argues that Footman failed to object to the district court's final instructions and that, as a result, our review is for plain error. Because we find, upon de novo review, that the instructions given did not cause prejudice to Footman, we do not address the issue of whether Footman preserved this claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  In his brief, Footman points to the trial judge's last instruction (the one including the \"counsel, command, induce\" language) in his claim that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury. That last instruction was a correct statement of the law, and it clearly articulated the elements for both the direct participation and the aiding and abetting theories of criminal liability. We assume Footman's argument that the trial judge committed error is really in response to her having defined \"knowing transportation,\" on a number of occasions, to include \"cause to be transported.\" These statements did not correctly describe the elements of &#167; 2421. As already noted, \"transport\" in &#167; 2421 does not include \"causing\" the transportation of an individual. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567584\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sabatino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/567584/united-states-v-diane-sabatino-united-states-of-america-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>.</p>\n        <p>Footman may also be claiming that it was improper to instruct the jury on aiding and abetting liability at all. If so, this argument is without merit. Footman was charged under both the substantive statutory sections and the aiding and abetting statute, and the evidence put on by the government sufficed to allow the issue to go to the jury.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  A different situation might arise in a case where the prosecution's theory was that the defendant \"caused\" the prostitute to transport herself across state lines by persuading her to do so, whether by sweet talk, for a bonus, or the like. In such a case, the question of whether the \"causation\" involved would suffice to constitute knowing transportation under the substantive statutory sections is a real question. That was not the evidence or the government's theory here, and so we do not need to explore this nuanced meaning of the phrase \"knowingly transport.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p>  The government had another theory of admissibility: that the calls were placed on telephone equipment being used in the ordinary course of their duties by investigative or law enforcement officers. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(5)(a)(ii). We do not reach this argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p>  Title III itself explicitly considers that those engaged in oral communications may have reduced privacy expectations and assumes that there are protectable privacy interests in wire communications. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(1), (2). We do not address whether those privacy interests are given up by a person, outside of the prison context, merely because she accepts a call that has been preceded by a phone company announcement that the call is being recorded.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p>  In passing the legislation, Congress was concerned with protecting the privacy of individual citizens while providing for the effective use of electronic surveillance to combat organized crime. See S. Rep. No. 90-1097 (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2153-63. There is little reason to believe that Congress was concerned with the privacy interests of prison inmates.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p>  There may, of course, be \"occasional applications that might raise hard questions.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709489\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Langton,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/709489/william-langton-and-david-leblanc-v-william-hogan-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">941</span> </a></span>(Boudin, J., dissenting).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p>  Under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 4A1.2(d) and 4A1.2(e), Footman's juvenile convictions and his adult convictions from more than ten years prior to the present offenses (and that resulted in sentences of thirteen months or less) were not included in his initial CHC calculation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
