This appeal is the latest\n\ninstallment in a series growing out of New Hampshire's efforts\n\nto deregulate the electric utility industry and trim rates for\n\ncustomers. 1       Familiarity with our prior decisions is assumed.\n\nWe repeat here only those facts pertinent to the present issue.\n\n            Connecticut     Valley    Electric   Company      (\"Connecticut\n\nValley\"),      a   small   New   Hampshire   utility,   provides     retail\n\nelectric service to about 10,000 customers in New Hampshire.\n\nConnecticut Valley purchases about 76 percent of its power from\n\nits parent company, Central Vermont Public Service Corporation\n\n(\"Central      Vermont\"),   a    Vermont   utility,   under    a   wholesale\n\nrequirements contract (\"the RS-2 contract\") that incorporates\n\ncost-of-service rates (\"the RS-2 rate schedule\") filed with and\n\nregulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\").\n\nConnecticut Valley and Central Vermont have had a requirements\n\ncontract incorporating some form of the RS-2 rate schedule since\n\n1982.\n\n\n\n\n     1Public Serv. Co. v. Patch, 962 F. Supp. 222 (D.N.H. 1997)\n(Patch I); Public Serv. Co. v. Patch, 173 F.R.D. 17 (D.N.H.\n1997) (Patch II); Public Serv. Co. v. Patch, 136 F.3d 197 (1st\nCir. 1998) (Patch III); Public Serv. Co. v. Patch, 167 F.3d 15\n(1st Cir. 1998) (Patch IV); Public Serv. Co. v. Patch, 167 F.3d\n29 (1st Cir. 1998) (Patch V), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1066\n(1999); Public Serv. Co. v. Patch, 202 F.3d 29 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(Patch VI); Public Serv. Co. v. Patch, 87 F. Supp. 2d 57 (D.N.H.\n2000) (Patch VII).\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           The RS-2 contract has a termination clause that, read\n\nliterally, permits either party to terminate the contract at the\n\nend of a service year by giving written notice of termination\n\nbefore the beginning of that service year.                See Patch V, 167\n\nF.3d at 32.    Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont contend that\n\nthe termination clause was not intended to give either of them\n\nthe ability to terminate unilaterally on such short notice, but\n\nthe district court found it unnecessary to decide whether the\n\none-year   termination    clause       allows     Connecticut     Valley   to\n\nterminate on the specified notice if and when its own interests\n\nso dictate.\n\n           Central Vermont's rates under the RS-2 contract with\n\nConnecticut    Valley   are   higher     than     the   current   rates    for\n\nwholesale electricity available elsewhere in New Hampshire, due\n\nin part to an expensive long-term contract by which Central\n\nVermont purchases from Hydro Quebec.            In February 1997, as part\n\nof its restructuring of electricity regulation in New Hampshire,\n\nthe New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (\"the Commission\")\n\nfound   that   Connecticut    Valley     should    have   given   notice   of\n\ntermination of its RS-2 contract on or before December 31, 1996.\n\nThis finding was made in computing the so-called \"stranded cost\n\nrecovery charge\" that Connecticut Valley would otherwise be\n\nallowed to recover from customers as part of the deregulation\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fprocess.    Re Connecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No. 22,509\n\n(Feb. 28, 1997) (the \"Stranded Cost Recovery Order\").2\n\n           Concerned that Connecticut Valley would terminate the\n\nRS-2 contract and thereby leave Central Vermont alone with a\n\nlong-term obligation to buy expensive power from Hydro Quebec,\n\nCentral Vermont in June 1997 filed with FERC its own proposal to\n\nterminate the RS-2 contract.              However, it made termination\n\ncontingent on FERC allowing Central Vermont to add a \"stranded\n\ncost surcharge\" on power delivered over its transmission lines\n\nto   customers   in   Connecticut    Valley's    service   area.   FERC\n\nrejected that proposal as inconsistent with earlier FERC orders\n\nand regulations, but decided to allow Central Vermont to file a\n\ndifferent plan that would impose an exit fee on Connecticut\n\nValley at the contract's termination, and thus ensure that\n\nConnecticut Valley shared in the loss to Central Vermont that\n\nwould result from termination of the contract.          See Central Vt.\n\nPub. Serv. Corp., 81 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,336, at 62,543 (1997), aff'd,\n\n--F.3d--, No. 98-1532, 2000 WL 762766 (D.C. Cir. June 30, 2000).\n\n\n      2\n     \"Stranded costs\" is a loose concept referring, in the\npresent context, primarily to investments that a utility made\nduring the period of monopoly service which are jeopardized by\nderegulation--for example, by new obligations to allow the\nutility's lines to be used by other suppliers.             The\nrestructuring and deregulation process in New Hampshire,\nincluding the statute and the Commission's evolving plan to\nimplement it, are described in detail in Patch IV, 167 F.3d at\n18-22.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           In December 1997, Central Vermont notified FERC that\n\nit would seek a tariff amendment to establish an exit fee (to\n\nrecover its own stranded costs).           The recovery of stranded costs\n\nat   the   wholesale    level   is   the    subject     of   extensive   FERC\n\nregulation, recently sustained in almost all respects by the\n\nD.C. Circuit in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC,\n\n--F.3d--, Nos. 97-1715 et al., 2000 WL 762706, at *24 (D.C. Cir.\n\nJune 30, 2000).    FERC accepted the proposed exit fee provision\n\nfor filing in March 1998.       See Central Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 82\n\nF.E.R.C. ¶ 61,237, at 61,908 (1998).             A hearing has now been\n\nheld before an administrative law judge at FERC, but no decision\n\non either the propriety or the amount of the fee has yet been\n\nissued.\n\n           In late December 1997, as the state's restructuring\n\nproceedings continued, Connecticut Valley applied for a routine\n\nincrease in its 1998 retail rates to incorporate increases in\n\nCentral Vermont's RS-2 rate schedule.            Such adjustments to the\n\nRS-2   schedule   are   made    periodically     by    Central   Vermont   to\n\nreflect changes in its cost of acquiring power, and, in the\n\npast, the Commission has allowed them to be passed through by\n\nConnecticut Valley to its own customers.              FERC accepted Central\n\nVermont's increased RS-2 rates for filing on January 13, 1998.\n\nThis time, instead of approving the requested increase, the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fstate commission found Connecticut Valley imprudent for not\n\nterminating the RS-2 contract sooner because power was available\n\nfor   less   money        on    the   open    market,    and   it   disallowed   the\n\nrequested increase.              Connecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No.\n\n22,815 (Dec. 31, 1997) (\"the Disallowance Order\").                     This finding\n\nparalleled        the   reasoning      behind      its   Stranded    Cost   Recovery\n\nOrder.\n\n             In     the        same   period,      litigation       concerning   New\n\nHampshire's plan for restructuring the electric utility industry\n\nwas   proceeding        in     this   court    and   the   district     court.    In\n\nDecember 1998, we upheld a preliminary injunction in which the\n\ndistrict court prohibited the Commission from implementing its\n\nbroad deregulation plan.              Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 28-29.          However,\n\nin a companion decision, Patch V, we vacated the injunction to\n\nthe extent it required the Commission to allow Connecticut\n\nValley to recover through its retail rates the full cost of\n\nwholesale power purchased under the RS-2 contract.                      167 F.3d at\n\n36.   We found that Connecticut Valley had not shown a likelihood\n\nthat the Disallowance Order was enjoinable by a federal court\n\nunder the restrictive terms of the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1342\n\n(1994).\n\n             Our decision in Patch V permitted the Commission to\n\nroll back Connecticut Valley's retail rates to the 1997 level.\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fHowever, after that decision, the Commission ordered Connecticut\n\nValley to reduce its rates temporarily below the 1997 level in\n\norder to refund to customers the higher rates they had paid\n\nwhile the district court's preliminary injunction was in effect.\n\nConnecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No. 23,168 (Mar. 22, 1999)\n\n(\"the Refund Order\").        Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont\n\nobjected to the district court regarding this further reduction;\n\nthe district court agreed; and on April 7, 1999, it enjoined the\n\nCommission from ordering the refund.              The Commission again\n\nappealed to this court.\n\n           In Patch VI, decided on January 24, 2000, we found that\n\nthe injunction against the Refund Order could not be sustained\n\non the basis thus far supplied, but allowed the district court\n\n90 days to provide a sufficient basis for such an injunction.\n\n202 F.3d at 34-35.     The district court then sought to supply\n\nthat explanation and, at the same time, to dispose of the\n\nparties' cross-motions for summary judgment as to the underlying\n\ndispute.   On March 6, 2000, the district court concluded that\n\nConnecticut   Valley   and    Central   Vermont    are    entitled   to   a\n\npermanent injunction allowing Connecticut Valley to pass through\n\nto its retail customers the cost of wholesale power it purchases\n\nfrom Central Vermont under the RS-2 contract.            Patch VII, 87 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 65.   The Commission now appeals.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f            The district court's summary judgment decision, which\n\nwe review de novo, Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 100\n\nF.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996), rested in major part on an order\n\nof   the   Commission   issued   on   July   22,    1998,   in   which   the\n\nCommission vacated a directive in its February 1997 Stranded\n\nCost Recovery Order,     Re Statewide Elec. Util. Restructuring\n\nPlan, Order No. 22,986 (July 22, 1998) (\"the Vacation Order\").\n\nIn particular, the Vacation Order canceled the Commission's\n\nprior directive instructing Connecticut Valley to terminate the\n\nRS-2 contract.    Because the Commission no longer demanded that\n\nConnecticut Valley terminate its RS-2 Contract on the basis of\n\nits \"imprudence,\" the district court ruled that federal law\n\nrequired the Commission to allow recovery of the federal tariff\n\nrate for purchases under that contract.            Patch VII, 87 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 64-65.\n\n            We begin our review with the main legal constraint that\n\ngoverns federal injunctions against state utility rates.             Where\n\nsuch relief is sought, it is not enough for the utility to\n\nestablish federal jurisdiction and a claim for relief on the\n\nmerits; it must also show that the injunction comports with the\n\nJohnson Act, which allows such injunctions only under very\n\nlimited conditions.     One such condition is where the state rate\n\norder conflicts with a federal statute or a federal agency\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\faction.      See Patch V, 167 F.3d at 33 (citing case law).        The\n\nshowing of such a conflict would normally satisfy the Johnson\n\nAct    and   make out a federal claim for relief.           See, e.g.,\n\nMississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi, 487 U.S. 354, 377\n\n(1988).\n\n             The issue in this case is not about these principles,\n\nwhich are well-settled, but about whether on the facts before us\n\nthe challenged orders of the state commission are inconsistent\n\nwith    a    federal   regulatory   scheme.     Patently,   the   state\n\ncommission is refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to collect\n\nrevenues to pay the full federal tariff rate for the power it is\n\nbuying from Central Vermont under the RS-2 tariff; indeed, the\n\nrefund ordered by the Commission is designed to make Connecticut\n\nValley give back to customers some of the revenue it collected\n\nfor that purpose.\n\n             Of course, FERC has not ordered the state commission\n\nto do anything; it has merely allowed Central Vermont to file a\n\nfederal tariff (the RS-2 tariff) setting a rate for wholesale\n\npower sales to Connecticut Valley.         But if the purchase is not\n\nimproper, then the refusal of the state commission to allow the\n\npurchasing utility to pay the federal tariff rate, and include\n\nthat cost in its own rates, is inconsistent with the federal\n\nscheme.      The reason is that the rates set by the FERC tariff are\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fbinding unless and until altered by FERC.          See Mississippi Power\n\n& Light Co., 487 U.S. at 371-74; Nantahala Power & Light Co. v.\n\nThornburg, 476 U.S. 953, 970 (1986).\n\n          Nevertheless, while the Supreme Court left the issue\n\nopen, we held in Patch V that a state commission could disallow\n\ncosts, even where they reflected payments required under a\n\nfederal   tariff,     where    the    state   agency    had   a   colorable\n\nindependent state ground for finding that the purchaser should\n\nnot have made the purchase.          167 F.3d at 35; see also Kentucky\n\nW. Va. Gas Co. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 837 F.2d 600,\n\n608-09 (3d Cir.),      cert. denied, 488 U.S. 941 (1988).              And,\n\ninitially,     the Commission did make a colorable ruling in its\n\nDisallowance     Order    that       Connecticut   Valley's       continued\n\npurchasing from Central Vermont was imprudent, given Connecticut\n\nValley's apparent opportunity to terminate its contract on one\n\nyear's notice and switch to cheaper--albeit possibly short-term-\n\n-power from other suppliers.\n\n          But faced with the threat of termination, Central\n\nVermont then filed a tariff amendment that now threatens to\n\nimpose a heavy termination charge on Connecticut Valley if it\n\ndoes cancel its contract.        FERC (which more or less invited the\n\namendment)     has   allowed   the     amendment   to    go   into   effect\n\nprovisionally and, while FERC may in due course disallow the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fcharge or reduce its amount, the amendment is in force for the\n\ntime       being.     See   82    F.E.R.C.       ¶    61,237,   at   61,909   (1998)\n\n(\"Central Vermont's proposed exit fee is hereby accepted for\n\nfiling and suspended for a nominal period, to become effective\n\non March 14, 1998, subject to refund . . . .\"). Further, the\n\nstate commission has now, in its Vacation Order, explicitly\n\nwithdrawn       the   prior      ruling   that       Connecticut     Valley   should\n\nterminate its requirements contract.                    In sum, the Commission's\n\nprior       justification        for   disallowing        the   pass-through     has\n\nevaporated.\n\n              The Commission says on appeal that its Vacation Order\n\nonly nullified its prior order requiring Connecticut Valley to\n\nterminate the contract and did not affirmatively order the\n\nutility to continue buying under the contract.                       The lack of an\n\naffirmative order is irrelevant:                     the RS-2 contract requiring\n\npurchases is binding on Connecticut Valley unless terminated;\n\ntermination now apparently would be self-defeating because it\n\nwould give rise to the prospect of a potentially heavy financial\n\npenalty that the state commission does not want;3 and so long as\n\n\n\n       3\n      Seemingly, a large exit fee would negate the savings\nrealized from having Connecticut Valley purchase cheaper power\nin the short term from wholesalers other than Central Vermont;\nand, of course, Connecticut Valley would also lose the long-term\nrate protection afforded Connecticut Valley's customers by the\nlong-term contract between Central Vermont and Hydro Quebec.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fpurchases from Central Vermont continue to be legitimately made\n\nunder the contract, Connecticut Valley must pay the FERC tariff\n\nrate, and the state commission must allow it to reflect that\n\nrate in its own charges.\n\n           Alternatively, the Commission says that even if current\n\nconditions    make   it     prudent   to     continue    the   purchases,   the\n\ncontract could and should have been terminated before Central\n\nVermont filed the termination charge.              However, read literally,\n\nFERC regulations say that Central Vermont could have imposed the\n\ntermination    charge,      assuming       it   were    otherwise   justified,\n\nwhenever Connecticut Valley sought to terminate its contract--so\n\nlong as the contract was still in force when the charge was\n\nfiled.    18 C.F.R. § 35.26(c)(1)(v) (1999).               The RS-2 contract\n\nrequired at least one-year's notice before termination became\n\neffective.\n\n           The Commission points to language in the original FERC\n\norder    adopting    such    regulations,       arguably    contrary   to   the\n\npresent regulation itself, saying that a selling utility could\n\nnot add an exit fee after a purchasing utility \"gives notice\" of\n\ntermination.    Order No. 888, Promoting Wholesale Competition\n\nThrough Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by\n\nPublic Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities\n\nand Transmitting Utilities, 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540, 21,642 n.679\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f(1996).     However this arguable tension between the regulation\n\nand order may be resolved, it is hard to see how Connecticut\n\nValley--a     wholly-owned      subsidiary--could       have    effected     a\n\nsurprise termination. 4         Also, the FERC order says that even\n\nwhere   notice    is   given,   the    seller   could   still   recover    its\n\nstranded costs through transmission charges to the canceling\n\nutility.

We repeat here only those facts pertinent to the present issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connecticut Valley Electric Company (\"Connecticut Valley\"), a small New Hampshire utility, provides retail electric service to about 10,000 customers in New Hampshire. Connecticut Valley purchases about 76 percent of its power from its parent company, Central Vermont Public Service Corporation (\"Central Vermont\"), a Vermont utility, under a wholesale requirements contract (\"the RS-2 contract\") that incorporates cost-of-service rates (\"the RS-2 rate schedule\") filed with and regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\"). Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont have had a requirements contract incorporating some form of the RS-2 rate schedule since 1982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RS-2 contract has a termination clause that, read literally, permits either party to terminate the contract at the end of a service year by giving written notice of termination before the beginning of that service year. See Patch V, 167 F.3d at 32. Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont contend that the termination clause was not intended to give either of them the ability to terminate unilaterally on such short notice, but the district court found it unnecessary to decide whether the one-year termination clause allows Connecticut Valley to terminate on the specified notice if and when its own interests so dictate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central Vermont's rates under the RS-2 contract with Connecticut Valley are higher than the current rates for wholesale electricity available elsewhere in New Hampshire, due in part to an expensive long-term contract by which Central Vermont purchases from Hydro Quebec. In February 1997, as part of its restructuring of electricity regulation in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (\"the Commission\") found that Connecticut Valley should have given notice of termination of its RS-2 contract on or before December 31, 1996. This finding was made in computing the so-called \"stranded cost recovery charge\" that Connecticut Valley would otherwise be allowed to recover from customers as part of the deregulation process. Re Connecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No. 22,509 (Feb. 28, 1997) (the \"Stranded Cost Recovery Order\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned that Connecticut Valley would terminate the RS-2 contract and thereby leave Central Vermont alone with a long-term obligation to buy expensive power from Hydro Quebec, Central Vermont in June 1997 filed with FERC its own proposal to terminate the RS-2 contract. However, it made termination contingent on FERC allowing Central Vermont to add a \"stranded cost surcharge\" on power delivered over its transmission lines to customers in Connecticut Valley's service area. FERC rejected that proposal as inconsistent with earlier FERC orders and regulations, but decided to allow Central Vermont to file a different plan that would impose an exit fee on Connecticut Valley at the contract's termination, and thus ensure that Connecticut Valley shared in the loss to Central Vermont that would result from termination of the contract. See Central Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 81 F.E.R.C. &#182; 61,336, at 62,543 (1997), aff'd, 214 F.3d 1336 (D.C. Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1997, Central Vermont notified FERC that it would seek a tariff amendment to establish an exit fee (to recover its own stranded costs). The recovery of stranded costs at the wholesale level is the subject of extensive FERC regulation, recently sustained in almost all respects by the D.C. Circuit in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, ___ F.3d ___, ___, Nos. 97-1715 et al., 2000 WL 762706, at *24 (D.C. Cir. June 30, 2000). FERC accepted the proposed exit fee provision for filing in March 1998. See Central Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 82 F.E.R.C. &#182; 61,237, at 61,908 (1998). A hearing has now been held before an administrative law judge at FERC, but no decision on either the propriety or the amount of the fee has yet been issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late December 1997, as the state's restructuring proceedings continued, Connecticut Valley applied for a routine increase in its 1998 retail rates to incorporate increases in Central Vermont's RS-2 rate schedule. Such adjustments to the RS-2 schedule are made periodically by Central Vermont to reflect changes in its cost of acquiring power, and, in the past, the Commission has allowed them to be passed through by Connecticut Valley to its own customers. FERC accepted Central Vermont's increased RS-2 rates for filing on January 13, 1998. This time, instead of approving the requested increase, the state commission found Connecticut Valley imprudent for not terminating the RS-2 contract sooner because power was available for less money on the open market, and it disallowed the requested increase. Connecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No. 22,815 (Dec. 31, 1997) (\"the Disallowance Order\"). This finding paralleled the reasoning behind its Stranded Cost Recovery Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same period, litigation concerning New Hampshire's plan for restructuring the electric utility industry was proceeding in this court and the district court. In December 1998, we upheld a preliminary injunction in which the district court prohibited the Commission from implementing its broad deregulation plan. Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 28-29. However, in a companion decision, Patch V, we vacated the injunction to the extent it required the Commission to allow Connecticut Valley to recover through its retail rates the full cost of wholesale power purchased under the RS-2 contract. 167 F.3d at 36. We found that Connecticut Valley had not shown a likelihood that the Disallowance Order was enjoinable by a federal court under the restrictive terms of the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1342 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Patch V permitted the Commission to roll back Connecticut Valley's retail rates to the 1997 level. However, after that decision, the Commission ordered Connecticut Valley to reduce its rates temporarily below the 1997 level in order to refund to customers the higher rates they had paid while the district court's preliminary injunction was in effect. Connecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No. 23,168 (Mar. 22, 1999) (\"the Refund Order\"). Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont objected to the district court regarding this further reduction; the district court agreed; and on April 7, 1999, it enjoined the Commission from ordering the refund. The Commission again appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Patch VI, decided on January 24, 2000, we found that the injunction against the Refund Order could not be sustained on the basis thus far supplied, but allowed the district court 90 days to provide a sufficient basis for such an injunction. 202 F.3d at 34-35. The district court then sought to supply that explanation and, at the same time, to dispose of the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment as to the underlying dispute. On March 6, 2000, the district court concluded that Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont are entitled to a permanent injunction allowing Connecticut Valley to pass through to its retail customers the cost of wholesale power it purchases from Central Vermont under the RS-2 contract. Patch VII, 87 F. Supp. 2d at 65. The Commission now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's summary judgment decision, which we review de novo, Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 100 F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996), rested in major part on an order of the Commission issued on July 22, 1998, in which the Commission vacated a directive in its February 1997 Stranded Cost Recovery Order, Re Statewide Elec. Util. Restructuring Plan, Order No. 22,986 (July 22, 1998) (\"the Vacation Order\"). In particular, the Vacation Order canceled the Commission's prior directive instructing Connecticut Valley to terminate the RS-2 contract. Because the Commission no longer demanded that Connecticut Valley terminate its RS-2 Contract on the basis of its \"imprudence,\" the district court ruled that federal law required the Commission to allow recovery of the federal tariff rate for purchases under that contract. Patch VII, 87 F. Supp. 2d at 64-65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our review with the main legal constraint that governs federal injunctions against state utility rates. Where such relief is sought, it is not enough for the utility to establish federal jurisdiction and a claim for relief on the merits; it must also show that the injunction comports with the Johnson Act, which allows such injunctions only under very limited conditions. One such condition is where the state rate order conflicts with a federal statute or a federal agency action. See Patch V, 167 F.3d at 33 (citing case law). The showing of such a conflict would normally satisfy the Johnson Act and make out a federal claim for relief. See, e.g., Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi, 487 U.S. 354, 377 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue in this case is not about these principles, which are well-settled, but about whether on the facts before us the challenged orders of the state commission are inconsistent with a federal regulatory scheme. Patently, the state commission is refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to collect revenues to pay the full federal tariff rate for the power it is buying from Central Vermont under the RS-2 tariff; indeed, the refund ordered by the Commission is designed to make Connecticut Valley give back to customers some of the revenue it collected for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, FERC has not ordered the state commission to do anything; it has merely allowed Central Vermont to file a federal tariff (the RS-2 tariff) setting a rate for wholesale power sales to Connecticut Valley. But if the purchase is not improper, then the refusal of the state commission to allow the purchasing utility to pay the federal tariff rate, and include that cost in its own rates, is inconsistent with the federal scheme. The reason is that the rates set by the FERC tariff are binding unless and until altered by FERC. See Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co., 487 U.S. at 371-74; Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953, 970 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, while the Supreme Court left the issue open, we held in Patch V that a state commission could disallow costs, even where they reflected payments required under a federal tariff, where the state agency had a colorable independent state ground for finding that the purchaser should not have made the purchase. 167 F.3d at 35; see also Kentucky W. Va. Gas Co. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 837 F.2d 600, 608-09 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 941 (1988). And, initially, the Commission did make a colorable ruling in its Disallowance Order that Connecticut Valley's continued purchasing from Central Vermont was imprudent, given Connecticut Valley's apparent opportunity to terminate its contract on one year's notice and switch to cheaper--albeit possibly short-term--power from other suppliers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But faced with the threat of termination, Central Vermont then filed a tariff amendment that now threatens to impose a heavy termination charge on Connecticut Valley if it does cancel its contract. FERC (which more or less invited the amendment) has allowed the amendment to go into effect provisionally and, while FERC may in due course disallow the charge or reduce its amount, the amendment is in force for the time being. See 82 F.E.R.C. &#182; 61,237, at 61,909 (1998) (\"Central Vermont's proposed exit fee is hereby accepted for filing and suspended for a nominal period, to become effective on March 14, 1998, subject to refund....\"). Further, the state commission has now, in its Vacation Order, explicitly withdrawn the prior ruling that Connecticut Valley should terminate its requirements contract. In sum, the Commission's prior justification for disallowing the pass-through has evaporated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission says on appeal that its Vacation Order only nullified its prior order requiring Connecticut Valley to terminate the contract and did not affirmatively order the utility to continue buying under the contract. The lack of an affirmative order is irrelevant: the RS-2 contract requiring purchases is binding on Connecticut Valley unless terminated; termination now apparently would be self-defeating because it would give rise to the prospect of a potentially heavy financial penalty that the state commission does not want;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and so long as purchases from Central Vermont continue to be legitimately made under the contract, Connecticut Valley must pay the FERC tariff rate, and the state commission must allow it to reflect that rate in its own charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the Commission says that even if current conditions make it prudent to continue the purchases, the contract could and should have been terminated before Central Vermont filed the termination charge. However, read literally, FERC regulations say that Central Vermont could have imposed the termination charge, assuming it were otherwise justified, whenever Connecticut Valley sought to terminate its contract--so long as the contract was still in force when the charge was filed. 18 C.F.R. &#167; 35.26(c)(1)(v) (1999). The RS-2 contract required at least one-year's notice before termination became effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission points to language in the original FERC order adopting such regulations, arguably contrary to the present regulation itself, saying that a selling utility could not add an exit fee after a purchasing utility \"gives notice\" of termination. Order No. 888, Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities, 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540, 21,642 n.679 (1996). However this arguable tension between the regulation and order may be resolved, it is hard to see how Connecticut Valley--a wholly-owned subsidiary--could have effected a surprise termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Also, the FERC order says that even where notice is given, the seller could still recover its stranded costs through transmission charges to the canceling utility. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Commission, joined in a separate amica curiae brief by the Governor of New Hampshire, claims that whether the continued purchases are imprudent under state law is a matter for the Commission and the state courts, and that the district court's injunction is inconsistent with the so-called Burford doctrine. See Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 332-34 (1943). Burford, discussed at some length in Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 24, aims to prevent federal courts from \"bypassing a state administrative scheme and resolving issues of state law and policy that are committed in the first instance to expert administrative resolution.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we are not concerned here with whether the imprudence finding is proper under state law but rather with whether, given its substance and context, it furnishes a basis for the state commission to ignore an otherwise controlling FERC tariff. In such cases, the \"adequacy\" of an asserted \"independent state ground\" is--indeed, under the Supremacy Clause must be--an issue of federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Burford does not license a state to ignore FERC tariffs merely by saying, without any present rational basis, that the purchase is \"imprudent.\" This is so even if the Commission's \"imprudence\" finding has not been withdrawn and is still tolerated under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it of any moment whether the Commission has, or has not, acted in good faith in refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to collect the FERC tariff charges. Indeed, we assume throughout that the Commission is motivated simply by a desire to secure lower rates for New Hampshire consumers. But absent a colorable objective justification, the state agency may not disallow, in state rate-making proceedings, costs that were incurred under a federal tariff for a permissible purchase of wholesale power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Public Serv.

We repeat here only those facts pertinent to the present issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connecticut Valley Electric Company (\"Connecticut Valley\"), a small New Hampshire utility, provides retail electric service to about 10,000 customers in New Hampshire. Connecticut Valley purchases about 76 percent of its power from its parent company, Central Vermont Public Service Corporation (\"Central Vermont\"), a Vermont utility, under a wholesale requirements contract (\"the RS-2 contract\") that incorporates cost-of-service rates (\"the RS-2 rate schedule\") filed with and regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\"). Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont have had a requirements contract incorporating some form of the RS-2 rate schedule since 1982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RS-2 contract has a termination clause that, read literally, permits either party to terminate the contract at the end of a service year by giving written notice of termination before the beginning of that service year. See Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">V,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">32</span></span>. Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont contend that the termination clause was not intended to give either of them the ability to terminate unilaterally on such short notice, but the district court found it unnecessary to decide whether the one-year termination clause allows Connecticut Valley to terminate on the specified notice if and when its own interests so dictate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central Vermont's rates under the RS-2 contract with Connecticut Valley are higher than the current rates for wholesale electricity available elsewhere in New Hampshire, due in part to an expensive long-term contract by which Central Vermont purchases from Hydro Quebec. In February 1997, as part of its restructuring of electricity regulation in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (\"the Commission\") found that Connecticut Valley should have given notice of termination of its RS-2 contract on or before December 31, 1996. This finding was made in computing the so-called \"stranded cost recovery charge\" that Connecticut Valley would otherwise be allowed to recover from customers as part of the deregulation process. Re Connecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No. 22,509 (Feb. 28, 1997) (the \"Stranded Cost Recovery Order\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned that Connecticut Valley would terminate the RS-2 contract and thereby leave Central Vermont alone with a long-term obligation to buy expensive power from Hydro Quebec, Central Vermont in June 1997 filed with FERC its own proposal to terminate the RS-2 contract. However, it made termination contingent on FERC allowing Central Vermont to add a \"stranded cost surcharge\" on power delivered over its transmission lines to customers in Connecticut Valley's service area. FERC rejected that proposal as inconsistent with earlier FERC orders and regulations, but decided to allow Central Vermont to file a different plan that would impose an exit fee on Connecticut Valley at the contract's termination, and thus ensure that Connecticut Valley shared in the loss to Central Vermont that would result from termination of the contract. See Central Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 81 F.E.R.C. &#182; 61,336, at 62,543 (1997), aff'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1336</span> </span>(D.C. Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1997, Central Vermont notified FERC that it would seek a tariff amendment to establish an exit fee (to recover its own stranded costs). The recovery of stranded costs at the wholesale level is the subject of extensive FERC regulation, recently sustained in almost all respects by the D.C. Circuit in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, ___ F.3d ___, ___, Nos. 97-1715 et al., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">762706</span></span>, at *24 (D.C. Cir. June 30, 2000). FERC accepted the proposed exit fee provision for filing in March 1998. See Central Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 82 F.E.R.C. &#182; 61,237, at 61,908 (1998). A hearing has now been held before an administrative law judge at FERC, but no decision on either the propriety or the amount of the fee has yet been issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late December 1997, as the state's restructuring proceedings continued, Connecticut Valley applied for a routine increase in its 1998 retail rates to incorporate increases in Central Vermont's RS-2 rate schedule. Such adjustments to the RS-2 schedule are made periodically by Central Vermont to reflect changes in its cost of acquiring power, and, in the past, the Commission has allowed them to be passed through by Connecticut Valley to its own customers. FERC accepted Central Vermont's increased RS-2 rates for filing on January 13, 1998. This time, instead of approving the requested increase, the state commission found Connecticut Valley imprudent for not terminating the RS-2 contract sooner because power was available for less money on the open market, and it disallowed the requested increase. Connecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No. 22,815 (Dec. 31, 1997) (\"the Disallowance Order\"). This finding paralleled the reasoning behind its Stranded Cost Recovery Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same period, litigation concerning New Hampshire's plan for restructuring the electric utility industry was proceeding in this court and the district court. In December 1998, we upheld a preliminary injunction in which the district court prohibited the Commission from implementing its broad deregulation plan. Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">IV,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">28-29</span></span>. However, in a companion decision, Patch V, we vacated the injunction to the extent it required the Commission to allow Connecticut Valley to recover through its retail rates the full cost of wholesale power purchased under the RS-2 <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">contract.</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">36</span></span>. We found that Connecticut Valley had not shown a likelihood that the Disallowance Order was enjoinable by a federal court under the restrictive terms of the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1342 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Patch V permitted the Commission to roll back Connecticut Valley's retail rates to the 1997 level. However, after that decision, the Commission ordered Connecticut Valley to reduce its rates temporarily below the 1997 level in order to refund to customers the higher rates they had paid while the district court's preliminary injunction was in effect. Connecticut Valley Elec. Co., Order No. 23,168 (Mar. 22, 1999) (\"the Refund Order\"). Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont objected to the district court regarding this further reduction; the district court agreed; and on April 7, 1999, it enjoined the Commission from ordering the refund. The Commission again appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Patch VI, decided on January 24, 2000, we found that the injunction against the Refund Order could not be sustained on the basis thus far supplied, but allowed the district court 90 days to provide a sufficient basis for such an <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">injunction.</span> <span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">34-35</span></span>. The district court then sought to supply that explanation and, at the same time, to dispose of the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment as to the underlying dispute. On March 6, 2000, the district court concluded that Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont are entitled to a permanent injunction allowing Connecticut Valley to pass through to its retail customers the cost of wholesale power it purchases from Central Vermont under the RS-2 contract. Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">VII,</span> <span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Commission now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's summary judgment decision, which we review de novo, Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729694\"><a href=\"/opinion/729694/douglas-t-wightman-v-springfield-terminal-railway-company-and-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 230 (1st Cir. 1996), rested in major part on an order of the Commission issued on July 22, 1998, in which the Commission vacated a directive in its February 1997 Stranded Cost Recovery Order, Re Statewide Elec. Util. Restructuring Plan, Order No. 22,986 (July 22, 1998) (\"the Vacation Order\"). In particular, the Vacation Order canceled the Commission's prior directive instructing Connecticut Valley to terminate the RS-2 contract. Because the Commission no longer demanded that Connecticut Valley terminate its RS-2 Contract on the basis of its \"imprudence,\" the district court ruled that federal law required the Commission to allow recovery of the federal tariff rate for purchases under that contract. Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">VII,</span> <span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">64-65</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our review with the main legal constraint that governs federal injunctions against state utility rates. Where such relief is sought, it is not enough for the utility to establish federal jurisdiction and a claim for relief on the merits; it must also show that the injunction comports with the Johnson Act, which allows such injunctions only under very limited conditions. One such condition is where the state rate order conflicts with a federal statute or a federal agency action. See Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">V,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">33</span> </span>(citing case law). The showing of such a conflict would normally satisfy the Johnson Act and make out a federal claim for relief. See, e.g., Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112130\"><a href=\"/opinion/112130/mississippi-power-light-co-v-mississippi-ex-rel-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 377 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue in this case is not about these principles, which are well-settled, but about whether on the facts before us the challenged orders of the state commission are inconsistent with a federal regulatory scheme. Patently, the state commission is refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to collect revenues to pay the full federal tariff rate for the power it is buying from Central Vermont under the RS-2 tariff; indeed, the refund ordered by the Commission is designed to make Connecticut Valley give back to customers some of the revenue it collected for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, FERC has not ordered the state commission to do anything; it has merely allowed Central Vermont to file a federal tariff (the RS-2 tariff) setting a rate for wholesale power sales to Connecticut Valley. But if the purchase is not improper, then the refusal of the state commission to allow the purchasing utility to pay the federal tariff rate, and include that cost in its own rates, is inconsistent with the federal scheme. The reason is that the rates set by the FERC tariff are binding unless and until altered by FERC. See Mississippi Power &amp; Light <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112130\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112130/mississippi-power-light-co-v-mississippi-ex-rel-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">371-74</span></a></span>; Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Va. Gas Co. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500359\"><a href=\"/opinion/500359/kentucky-west-virginia-gas-company-equitable-gas-company-a-division-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 608-09 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span> </span>(1988). And, initially, the Commission did make a colorable ruling in its Disallowance Order that Connecticut Valley's continued purchasing from Central Vermont was imprudent, given Connecticut Valley's apparent opportunity to terminate its contract on one year's notice and switch to cheaper--albeit possibly short-term--power from other suppliers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But faced with the threat of termination, Central Vermont then filed a tariff amendment that now threatens to impose a heavy termination charge on Connecticut Valley if it does cancel its contract. FERC (which more or less invited the amendment) has allowed the amendment to go into effect provisionally and, while FERC may in due course disallow the charge or reduce its amount, the amendment is in force for the time being. See 82 F.E.R.C. &#182; 61,237, at 61,909 (1998) (\"Central Vermont's proposed exit fee is hereby accepted for filing and suspended for a nominal period, to become effective on March 14, 1998, subject to refund....\"). Further, the state commission has now, in its Vacation Order, explicitly withdrawn the prior ruling that Connecticut Valley should terminate its requirements contract. In sum, the Commission's prior justification for disallowing the pass-through has evaporated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission says on appeal that its Vacation Order only nullified its prior order requiring Connecticut Valley to terminate the contract and did not affirmatively order the utility to continue buying under the contract. The lack of an affirmative order is irrelevant: the RS-2 contract requiring purchases is binding on Connecticut Valley unless terminated; termination now apparently would be self-defeating because it would give rise to the prospect of a potentially heavy financial penalty that the state commission does not want;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and so long as purchases from Central Vermont continue to be legitimately made under the contract, Connecticut Valley must pay the FERC tariff rate, and the state commission must allow it to reflect that rate in its own charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the Commission says that even if current conditions make it prudent to continue the purchases, the contract could and should have been terminated before Central Vermont filed the termination charge. However, read literally, FERC regulations say that Central Vermont could have imposed the termination charge, assuming it were otherwise justified, whenever Connecticut Valley sought to terminate its contract--so long as the contract was still in force when the charge was filed. 18 C.F.R. &#167; 35.26(c)(1)(v) (1999). The RS-2 contract required at least one-year's notice before termination became effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission points to language in the original FERC order adopting such regulations, arguably contrary to the present regulation itself, saying that a selling utility could not add an exit fee after a purchasing utility \"gives notice\" of termination. Order No. 888, Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities, 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540, 21,642 n.679 (1996). However this arguable tension between the regulation and order may be resolved, it is hard to see how Connecticut Valley--a wholly-owned subsidiary--could have effected a surprise termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Also, the FERC order says that even where notice is given, the seller could still recover its stranded costs through transmission charges to the canceling utility. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Commission, joined in a separate amica curiae brief by the Governor of New Hampshire, claims that whether the continued purchases are imprudent under state law is a matter for the Commission and the state courts, and that the district court's injunction is inconsistent with the so-called Burford doctrine. See Burford v. Sun Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103842\"><a href=\"/opinion/103842/burford-v-sun-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 332-34 (1943). Burford, discussed at some length in Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">IV,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>, aims to prevent federal courts from \"bypassing a state administrative scheme and resolving issues of state law and policy that are committed in the first instance to expert administrative resolution.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we are not concerned here with whether the imprudence finding is proper under state law but rather with whether, given its substance and context, it furnishes a basis for the state commission to ignore an otherwise controlling FERC tariff. In such cases, the \"adequacy\" of an asserted \"independent state ground\" is--indeed, under the Supremacy Clause must be--an issue of federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Burford does not license a state to ignore FERC tariffs merely by saying, without any present rational basis, that the purchase is \"imprudent.\" This is so even if the Commission's \"imprudence\" finding has not been withdrawn and is still tolerated under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it of any moment whether the Commission has, or has not, acted in good faith in refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to collect the FERC tariff charges. Indeed, we assume throughout that the Commission is motivated simply by a desire to secure lower rates for New Hampshire consumers. But absent a colorable objective justification, the state agency may not disallow, in state rate-making proceedings, costs that were incurred under a federal tariff for a permissible purchase of wholesale power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Public Serv.
