Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Peter L. Resnik, with whom Emily E. Smith-Lee and McDermott,\nWill & Emery, were on brief for appellant/cross-appellee.\n     James J. Foster, with whom Christopher S. Schultz and Wolf,\nGreenfield & Sacks, P.C., were on brief for appellee/cross-\n\fappellant.\n\n                                  March 31. 2000\n\n            STAHL, Circuit Judge.        At the conclusion of a nine-day\n\ntrial, a jury determined that defendant Babcock & Wilcox Canada\n\n(BWC)   had      breached     a    confidentiality       and   non-disclosure\n\nagreement that it had reached with a competitor, plaintiff\n\nFoster-Miller, Inc. (FMI).             The breach sued upon was BWC’s\n\nalleged use of confidential FMI technology in the development of\n\na small diameter, high pressure, flexible hose.                  The jury set\n\nFMI’s damages at $5,084,587.           BWC appeals from an interlocutory\n\norder denying one of its discovery motions, the judgment entered\n\npursuant    to     the    jury’s    verdict,    and   the   judgment    entered\n\npursuant to a memorandum and order denying its post-verdict\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law.                BWC’s principal claim\n\nis one of evidentiary insufficiency.                  FMI cross-appeals from\n\norders sanctioning it for a discovery abuse and denying its\n\nmotion for a partial new trial on damages.                  We affirm in all\n\nrespects.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            This    case    already    has     been   the   subject    of   three\n\npublished opinions.          See 46 F.3d 138 (1st Cir. 1995) (vacating\n\nand remanding 848 F. Supp. 271 (D. Mass. 1994)); 975 F. Supp. 30\n\n(D. Mass. 1997).         We therefore eschew a comprehensive recitation\n\n                                       -2-\n\fof the litigation and confine our present focus to matters\n\nrelevant to these appeals.      In doing so, we sometimes defer more\n\ndetailed descriptions of pertinent events to our discussions of\n\nthe specific arguments advanced.             And as in any case that\n\nchallenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we present the\n\nhistorical facts as the jury might have found them, consistent\n\nwith the record but in a light most favorable to the verdict.\n\nSee, e.g., Grajales-Romero v. American Airlines Inc., 194 F.3d\n\n288, 292 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            In the 1980s, both FMI and BWC became involved in the\n\nbusiness    of    cleaning    nuclear      powered   steam    generators.\n\nImpurities in the water boiled off in a nuclear generator leave\n\non   the   generator’s    bundled   tubes    an   often   extremely     hard\n\nsediment called \"sludge.\"       Over time, sludge deposits corrode\n\nand wear away the tubes.      Sludge-generated corrosion is a major\n\nproblem in nuclear generators.            If unchecked, it can lead to\n\nradioactive leaks and astronomically expensive plant shutdowns\n\nneeded to effectuate repairs.\n\n            In the 1980s, FMI and BWC were the only two companies\n\nengaged in the business of \"sludge lancing.\"              Sludge lancing\n\nflushes away accumulated sludge on a generator’s tubes with a\n\nthin   stream    of   pressurized   water    delivered    through   a   high\n\npressure hose encased within a metal water lance.             By the late\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f1980s, BWC had developed a manual sludge lancing system for\n\ncleaning the nuclear generators of Ontario Hydro, a Canadian\n\npublic utility.   The relationship between BWC and Ontario Hydro\n\nwas longstanding; BWC had designed Ontario Hydro’s generators.\n\nBut because the water lance and stainless steel reinforced hose\n\nin BWC’s system were insufficiently flexible to maneuver into\n\nmore than half of the many nooks and crannies between and among\n\nthe tube bundles in Ontario Hydro’s generators, the tubes –\n\nwhich are significantly closer together in Canadian generators\n\nthan in the typical United States commercial generator – were\n\ncaked with a disconcerting amount of unreachable sludge.\n\n          In contrast, by the late 1980s, FMI had developed a\n\nrobotically controlled \"flexlance\" sludge removal system.             As\n\ninitially designed, FMI’s lance contained a stainless steel\n\nbraided   hose   flexible   enough    to    bend    90   degrees.   This\n\nflexibility permitted the lance to enter the relatively wide\n\ngaps between and among the tubes in United States commercial\n\ngenerators for purposes of sludge removal.           In 1988, FMI began\n\nresearch into adapting its flexlance system for use on the steam\n\ngenerators used in United States Navy nuclear powered vessels.\n\nThe adaptation process was not straightforward because, like the\n\nCanadian generators, the naval generators had significantly\n\nsmaller   inter-tube    gaps   than        United    States   commercial\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fgenerators, and the lance and hose developed for use in the\n\ncommercial generators would not fit into these narrower spaces.\n\nThus, in August 1988, FMI began research into one of the central\n\nproblems of the adaption process and the problem at the heart of\n\nthis lawsuit:   acquiring or developing a hose small enough (.125\n\ninch outer diameter) to maneuver into the tube gaps in the naval\n\ngenerators, strong enough to withstand the very high burst\n\npressures (10,000 pounds per square inch) needed for effective\n\nsludge   removal,   and    yet   flexible   enough    to   bend   up   to   90\n\ndegrees.\n\n           Initially, FMI retained an outside consultant, Philip\n\nLichtman, to look into whether such a hose might be available\n\nfrom a commercial hose vendor.            Lichtman did not testify at\n\ntrial, but notes he made in connection with his hose search\n\n(which   were   admitted    into    evidence   over    BWC’s      objection)\n\nsuggested that his search was unsuccessful.           The following is an\n\nexcerpt from the so-called Lichtman notes that is particularly\n\nimportant to this appeal:\n\n                  Time after time, other vendors refer\n           to Rogan & Shanley as the prime source for\n           small-diameter high pressure hose. I spoke\n           with Dr. Rogan twice . . . . [T]here are\n           technical problems which Rogan feels may be\n           virtually insuperable at almost any price.\n           In short, Rogan thinks [FMI] is wasting\n           [its]   time;  that   only  [insufficiently\n           flexible] metal tube will do the job.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fIn other sections, the Lichtman notes indicate that a second\n\nvendor also had described the project as \"insuperable,\" and that\n\na third vendor had thought developing such a small, strong, and\n\nflexible hose would be \"very difficult.\"\n\n            In September 1988, an FMI engineer named Chip Babbitt\n\nconducted    a   second       commercial      hose     search.      Babbitt       used\n\nLichtman's    notes     as    a    starting    point    and   followed     up     with\n\nseveral of the vendors Lichtman previously had contacted.                         Like\n\nLichtman, Babbitt had no luck finding a commercial hose suitable\n\nfor the naval application.              He then mentioned his problem to\n\nanother FMI engineer, Jay Boyce.                Boyce suggested that a hose\n\nwith a Kevlar braid reinforcement be used.                    Kevlar is a strong\n\nand flexible fiber, but it is highly susceptible to fraying.\n\nBoyce also suggested that Babbitt discuss his problem with Glenn\n\nFreitas, an FMI engineer who had experience with fiber braiding.\n\nFreitas   concurred      in       Boyce’s    Kevlar    suggestion    and    further\n\nrecommended      that    the       braided     Kevlar    be      coated    with    an\n\nelastomeric matrix (i.e., a flexible coating typically made from\n\nrubber or plastic) to protect the Kevlar from abrasion.\n\n            Subsequently, Babbitt began to look for a company that\n\ncould manufacture a hose of the size and strength needed for the\n\nNavy project.     In the fall of 1988, Babbitt wrote to a number of\n\nhose manufacturers.           In his letters, he set forth the size,\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fflexibility, and pressure requirements of the contemplated hose.\n\nAlthough the letters explicitly mentioned the possibility of\n\nusing    stainless       steel   to    reinforce        the   hose   (the    approach\n\nadvocated by many of the manufacturers Babbitt had contacted\n\nduring his hose search), the letters also suggested that the\n\nhose might be constructed with a flexible nylon core, reinforced\n\nwith a Kevlar overbraid, and coated with a flexible elastomeric\n\nmatrix \"such as a urethane.\"                  One of the companies Babbitt\n\ncontacted at this time was U.S. Composites, a braiding company\n\nthat     had    not     previously         been   involved      in   designing     or\n\nmanufacturing hoses.\n\n               In December 1988, FMI commissioned U.S. Composites and\n\nanother manufacturer to create some Kevlar hose samples in the\n\nevent a suitable stainless steel reinforced hose could not be\n\ndesigned.       In January 1989, U.S. Composites shipped FMI a set of\n\nuncoated Kevlar-braided hose samples, which FMI found to be\n\n\"among    the     most    promising\"         of   the    hose    prototypes      then\n\navailable.        In February 1989, Daniel Fischbach, another FMI\n\nengineer, replaced Babbitt on the hose development project.                       The\n\nfollowing month, although FMI was still experimenting with a\n\nstainless steel reinforced hose, FMI and U.S. Composites entered\n\ninto a contract under which U.S. Composites would continue to\n\nmanufacture       and    supply       to    FMI   hose    samples     with    Kevlar\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\foverbraids.        This   contract,     along      with     two   other      FMI/U.S.\n\nComposites     contracts       covering        the        emerging     naval        hose\n\ntechnology, contained a confidentiality agreement designed to\n\nprotect the emerging technology.\n\n             In the spring and summer of 1989, FMI tested a number\n\nof    Kevlar-wrapped hose samples and experienced problems with\n\nbursting.      Throughout this time, FMI was still contemplating\n\nwhether to protect the Kevlar by coating it with a matrix such\n\nas urethane or      by surrounding it with a separate outside cover.\n\nBy fall, FMI was leaning towards a coated, coverless hose and\n\nhad U.S. Composites experimentally coat its samples with various\n\ntypes   of    urethanes     and    epoxies.          By    December      1989,      U.S.\n\nComposites had generated samples of hose using a number of\n\ndifferent coating materials.           Eventually, FMI chose for the Navy\n\nproject a hose with a nylon core, a single layer of Kevlar\n\nbraid, and a urethane coating.\n\n             Meanwhile, back in 1988, after FMI had begun work on\n\nthe   naval   project,      Ontario    Hydro       approached      FMI      about   the\n\npossibility of applying its flexlance technology to clean the\n\ntube bundles within its generators.             Shortly thereafter, William\n\nSchneider     of   BWC    called      FMI    and     proposed        that    the     two\n\ncompetitors cooperate, as each of the companies had information\n\nand   technology     that    might    prove    useful       in    solving     Ontario\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fHydro’s sludge problem.          Eventually, the companies submitted to\n\nOntario    Hydro     separate    proposals        for    jointly   studying     and\n\naddressing the problem.            The companies did not share their\n\nproposals     with     each     other,       as   each     proposal    contained\n\nconfidential       information.        FMI    subsequently     entered     into    a\n\nseparate agreement with Ontario Hydro to study the feasibility\n\nof using the flexlance system in Canadian generators.\n\n            In     January    1990,    FMI    assigned      William   Leary,      an\n\nengineer who had assisted in the completion of the Navy project,\n\nthe task of obtaining a flexible hose for a lance to be used in\n\nthe Canadian generators.              The hose could be slightly larger\n\n(.200 inch outer diameter) than the Navy hose, but it required\n\na   greater   pressure       retention    capacity.         Like   Lichtman     and\n\nBabbitt, Leary first attempted to find a suitable commercial\n\nhose.      Using    Lichtman’s    and    Babbitt’s        search   notes   as   his\n\nstarting      point,     Leary        contacted         twenty-five    different\n\nmanufacturers.       His search was unsuccessful.             Leary thus turned\n\nto the naval project engineers and asked how the Navy hose might\n\nbe adapted to the Canadian application.                   The engineers agreed\n\nthat wrapping a second layer of Kevlar around the hose might do\n\nthe trick.         Subsequently, FMI contacted U.S. Composites and\n\nasked it to create a hose similar to the Navy hose but with a\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fdouble wrap of Kevlar.              In early April 1990, U.S. Composites\n\nshipped samples of the requested hose to FMI.\n\n              Leary’s hose work proceeded as FMI was preparing its\n\nfeasibility study for Ontario Hydro.                        On May 11, 1990, an\n\nOntario Hydro representative agreed to travel to FMI’s research\n\nand   development       facility      in        Waltham,    Massachusetts,      for   a\n\nmeeting to discuss the progress of the study.                         Ontario Hydro\n\nrequested that a BWC engineer, Daniel St. Louis, also attend the\n\nmeeting.       St. Louis understood that he had been invited to\n\nprovide    input      with   respect       to     certain    water    lancing   tests\n\nnecessary to completion of the study.                  FMI agreed to St. Louis’\n\npresence but required BWC to execute a confidentiality agreement\n\nto protect confidential information that would be discussed at\n\nthe meeting.      In relevant part, the agreement provided that, for\n\na period of five years, BWC would not \"use FMI’s [confidential,\n\nproprietary      or    novel    information]          for    any     purpose    unless\n\nspecifically authorized in writing by FMI.\"                    The agreement also\n\nexplicitly      excluded       from       the    definition    of    \"confidential,\n\nproprietary or novel information\" that which, \"in its disclosed\n\ncombination[s], is in the public domain through no fault of\n\n[BWC].\"\n\n              The meeting lasted the better part of the day, and St.\n\nLouis   was    excluded      from     a    number    of     discussions   involving\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fsensitive   FMI   technology      and    information.       But    in    a    brief\n\npresentation towards the end of the meeting, Leary showed St.\n\nLouis a sample of the hose FMI was developing for the Canadian\n\napplication.      Leary told St. Louis that the hose had a nylon\n\ncore, Kevlar-wrap, and        urethane coating.         Leary also informed\n\nSt. Louis that U.S. Composites was manufacturing the hose for\n\nFMI.     Unbeknownst to Leary and FMI, St. Louis was at the time\n\nspearheading an effort by BWC to develop a 90-degree flexible\n\nlance of its own.         At some point after the meeting, St. Louis\n\ncalled   Leary    and     obtained      from   him   the   address       of    U.S.\n\nComposites.\n\n            Thereafter, St. Louis contacted U.S. Composites and\n\nspoke with its president, Hugo Kruesi.               St. Louis asked Kruesi\n\nif U.S. Composites could make for BWC \"a similar hose to that .\n\n. . provided for [FMI].\"          In the course of several subsequent\n\ntelephone conversations between Kruesi and St. Louis,                        Kruesi\n\nprovided    St.   Louis    with   two    price   quotations       and    detailed\n\ninformation regarding the FMI hose’s construction.                      St. Louis\n\nalso obtained from U.S. Composites a sample of FMI’s hose, which\n\nhe subjected to analysis and testing.                By the fall of 1990,\n\nhowever, Kruesi had become concerned that his interactions with\n\nBWC were violative of the confidentiality agreements between FMI\n\nand U.S. Composites.        He thus telephoned FMI and asked whether\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthere would be a problem if U.S. Composites were to produce a\n\nhigh pressure flexible hose for BWC.               FMI asked Kruesi to hold\n\noff on manufacturing anything for BWC.              Subsequently, BWC asked\n\nFMI for permission to develop a high pressure flexible hose\n\nthrough    U.S.    Composites,       but   FMI    declined      to   grant      such\n\npermission.\n\n           In March 1990, two months prior to the May 11 meeting\n\nat FMI, BWC had still been proposing sludge removal with the\n\nrelatively inflexible stainless steel technology it had been\n\nusing for years.          It was not until April 1990, when Ontario\n\nHydro suggested to it the need for a more flexible lance, that\n\nBWC even began to contemplate designing its own product capable\n\nof bending up to 90 degrees.          And it was not until after the May\n\n11 meeting, during the period of time that St. Louis initiated\n\ncontacts with U.S. Composites, that BWC documented any research\n\ninto the development of a such a product.\n\n           On June 20, 1990, BWC made its first proposal to\n\nOntario Hydro to develop a water lance of sufficient size and\n\nstrength   to     meet    Ontario    Hydro’s     sludge   lancing       needs   yet\n\ncapable of bending up to 90 degrees.              The proposal specifically\n\ndisclaimed      any      guarantee    of     success      \"in    view     of     the\n\ndevelopmental nature of the work.\"               At some point in the months\n\nthat followed, BWC performed its own unsuccessful search for a\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fcommercial hose suitable for use in Canadian generators.             During\n\nthis same period of time, St. Louis also subjected the FMI hose\n\nsample to destructive testing.          The FMI hose was the only sample\n\nSt. Louis ever tested.      By November 1990, BWC’s flexible lance\n\nwas complete \"except for the tubing.\"\n\n          Meanwhile, at some point after its efforts to work with\n\nU.S.   Composites   had   fallen   through,     BWC   contracted    with    a\n\nCanadian company known as Barrday to manufacture its hose.                 As\n\ninitially designed, the BWC hose, like the FMI hose, had a nylon\n\ncore reinforced with a sheathing of urethane-coated and braided\n\nKevlar.   But it was different in many respects.          Unlike the FMI\n\nhose, the BWC hose was not \"wet braided\"; it instead was pulled\n\nthrough a bucket of urethane (of a different type than that used\n\nby FMI) after the Kevlar had already been braided upon the hose.\n\nMoreover, the BWC hose had an outer abrasion cover.                Finally,\n\nthe BWC hose used thicker strands of Kevlar weaved onto the core\n\ntube at a somewhat different angle than that employed by FMI.\n\n          During    the   life     of    the   FMI/BWC   confidentiality\n\nagreement, Ontario Hydro sought bids on sixteen jobs requiring\n\nthe contractor to perform sludge removal with a water lance\n\nflexible enough to bend 90 degrees.         FMI successfully bid on one\n\nof these jobs; BWC won the other fifteen.             At trial, FMI took\n\nthe position that, but for BWC’s wrongful use of confidential\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\finformation regarding the FMI hose disclosed at the May 11, 1990\n\nmeeting, FMI would have won all sixteen contracts.   FMI’s theory\n\nwas that BWC copied and then built upon FMI’s basic hose design,\n\nthe basic elements of which (along with the name of the hose’s\n\nmanufacturer) BWC ascertained from Leary’s presentation at the\n\nmeeting.    FMI argued to the jury that this breach of the\n\nconfidentiality agreement permitted BWC to enter the relevant\n\nmarket quickly enough to secure contracts that otherwise would\n\nhave gone to FMI.   The jury agreed and, as we have stated, set\n\nFMI’s damages at just over five million dollars.     These cross-\n\nappeals followed.\n\n                               II.\n\n           BWC’s principal argument, made from various vantages,\n\nis that the district court erred in denying its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on evidentiary insufficiency.\n\nBWC also contends that the court erred in admitting the Lichtman\n\nnotes in evidence and then compounded its error by failing to\n\ngive a curative instruction after the notes were misused by FMI\n\nduring its closing argument.     Finally, BWC asserts that the\n\ncourt committed reversible error in instructing the jury on the\n\nweighing of expert testimony, in denying its motion in limine\n\nseeking to limit or exclude the testimony of FMI’s damages\n\nexpert, and in making certain FMI documents obtained by BWC\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fduring discovery the subject of a protective order.                  For its\n\npart, FMI argues that the court erred in declining to award it\n\na new trial on damages after erroneously precluding it from\n\nintroducing   lost     profits   evidence      relating    to    a   Canadian\n\nsubsidiary FMI established in 1994, and in             sanctioning it for\n\nfailing to comply with a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deposition\n\nnotice served during discovery by BWC.\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n          We review the district court’s denial of BWC’s motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law de novo, viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to FMI and drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor.      See, e.g., Collazo-Santiago v. Toyota\n\nMotor Corp., 149 F.3d 23, 27 (1 st Cir. 1998).             Our inquiry is\n\nwhether the evidence, when viewed from this perspective, would\n\n\"permit a reasonable jury to find in favor of [FMI] on any\n\npermissible   claim     or   theory.\"    Id.   (citation     and     internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n          We review the other district court actions challenged\n\nin these appeals only for an abuse of discretion.                See, e.g.,\n\nUnited   States   v.   Cunan,    152    F.3d   29,   36   (1st   Cir.   1998)\n\n(evidentiary rulings); Beatty v. Michael Bus. Machs. Corp., 172\n\nF.3d 117, 121 (1 st Cir. 1999) (decision whether the evidence\n\nwarrants a particular jury instruction);             Kumho Tire Co., Ltd.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fv. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 141-42 (1999) (decision whether to\n\nadmit challenged expert testimony); United States v. Gilbert,\n\n181 F.3d 152, 162 (1st Cir. 1999) (discovery rulings); Puerto\n\nRico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. v. Constructora Lluch, Inc., 169\n\nF.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir.) (denial of motion for new trial), cert.\n\ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 175 (1999).         We will not, however, uphold any\n\ndecision within the court’s discretion that has been tainted by\n\nan error of law.       See, e.g., United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171\n\nF.3d 24, 31 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 129 (1999).\n\nMoreover, we may affirm on any independently sufficient ground\n\nsupported by the record.      See, e.g., Ticketmaster-New York, Inc.\n\nv. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nB.   BWC’s Appeal\n\n            1.   Denial of Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n\n            BWC’s challenge to the district court’s denial of the\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law is, as we have stated, an\n\nevidentiary insufficiency argument pressed from various angles.\n\nPrimarily, BWC contends that, in denying the motion, the court\n\nerroneously      and   prejudicially     conceptualized   \"confidential\"\n\ninformation more broadly than is permitted under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, which the parties reasonably have agreed governs this\n\ndiversity    action.      See,   e.g.,    Merchants   Ins.   Co.   of   New\n\nHampshire, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., 143 F.3d 5, 8\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f(1st Cir. 1998) (we will give effect to the parties’ reasonable\n\nagreement as to controlling state law without further choice-of-\n\nlaw analysis).    To be specific, BWC argues that the information\n\ndisclosed at the May 11, 1990 meeting is not covered by the\n\nconfidentiality agreement because it was neither \"proprietary\"\n\nnor a \"trade secret\" and because, as a matter of Massachusetts\n\npublic policy, confidentiality agreements can protect only trade\n\nsecrets and proprietary information.     Central to this argument\n\nis a subsidiary claim that the information disclosed at the\n\nmeeting was neither a trade secret nor proprietary because it\n\nwas an obvious solution to an engineering problem derived from\n\ninformation in the public domain.\n\n          As an initial matter, a review of the Massachusetts\n\ncases BWC has cited leaves us in some doubt about whether and\n\nhow the Massachusetts courts differentiate between confidential\n\ninformation,     proprietary   information,   and    trade   secrets.\n\nCompare Warner-Lambert Co. v. Execuquest Corp., 691 N.E.2d 545,\n\n547 (Mass. 1998) (\"We further have recognized that confidential\n\nand   proprietary   business   information    may   be   entitled   to\n\nprotection, even if such information cannot claim trade secret\n\nprotection.\"), with Jet Spray Cooler, Inc.          v. Crampton, 385\n\nN.E.2d 1349, 1354 (Mass. 1979) (\"The essence of an action for\n\nthe wrongful use of trade secrets is the breach of the duty not\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fto   disclose      or     to     use        without        permission         confidential\n\ninformation acquired from another.\").                      But be that as it may, we\n\ndo not in this case measure the sufficiency of FMI’s evidence\n\nagainst   whatever       standard          Massachusetts         law   may     supply;   we\n\nmeasure it against the relevant jury instructions, which were\n\nnot patently erroneous and thus became the law of the case when\n\nBWC failed to object to them.                      See, e.g., United States v.\n\nZanghi,    189    F.3d     71,      79-80        (1 st    Cir.   1999)        (evidentiary\n\nsufficiency      is     measured       against           instructions     to     which   no\n\nobjection has been lodged, at least where such instructions are\n\nnot \"patently incorrect\"), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 839 (2000);\n\nCampos-Orrego      v.    Rivera,           175   F.3d      89,   97    (1st    Cir.   1999)\n\n(similar).\n\n           The district court instructed the jury extensively on\n\nthe issues implicated in BWC’s challenge to the denial of its\n\nmotion    for    judgment      as      a    matter        of   law.      Because      these\n\ninstructions are relevant not only to BWC’s primary argument,\n\nset forth above, but also to alternative arguments BWC advances\n\nin support of its challenge to the court’s ruling, described and\n\naddressed infra, we quote the instructions at some length:\n\n                  Now, this case involves an alleged\n           breach of contract that hinges on a seminal\n           event, the client briefing held at [FMI’s]\n           Waltham, Massachusetts, headquarters on May\n           11, 1990, which was attended by [BWC’s]\n           Daniel St. Louis.\n\n                                            -18-\n\f       Mr. St. Louis, as you will recall, was\nadmitted to portions of the briefing only\nafter BWC signed an agreement promising that\nit would not make any use for five years of\nconfidential information disclosed by [FMI].\nThat the agreement was a binding contract is\nnot in dispute.    What is disputed can be\nsketched as follows:\n\n       [FMI], the plaintiff, alleges that\nconfidential   information   regarding   the\nconstruction of its flexible lance hose,\nspecifically, the facts of its Kevlar braid\nand urethane coating, [and] the name of the\nsupplier, U.S. Composites, were disclosed to\nMr. St. Louis at the May 11 meeting.\n\n       [BWC], for its part, maintains that\nnothing   of  a  confidential  nature   was\nconveyed to Mr. St. Louis at that meeting.\nWhat   information  was   conveyed,   [BWC]\ncontends . . . was information that was in\nthe public domain.\n\n       In deciding this . . . issue, you will\nwant to consider the testimony that was\noffered about the May 11 meeting and about\nthe information that both preceded the\nmeeting and those [sic] that occurred\nafterward,   as  well   as   the   reasonable\ninferences that can be drawn from the entire\nhistory of the case.\n\n       If   you  find   that  confidential\ninformation was, in fact, disclosed to Mr.\nSt. Louis during the May 11 meeting, you\nwill then move to the second point of\ncontention.\n\n       [FMI] maintains that [BWC] used this\ninformation in developing a flexible lance\nof its own. [BWC] contends that its flexible\nlance was the brain child of its own\nengineers and technicians . . . who, [BWC]\nargues, conceived the lance without the\n\n\n                    -19-\n\fbenefit   or   use  of   any   confidential\ninformation provided by [FMI].\n\n       In resolving this issue, you will have\nto look to the testimony that has been\noffered as to how [BWC’s] flexible lance\ncame into being and the testimony that\nyou’ve heard about the similarities and the\ndifferences between the two lances.\n\n          *          *           *\n\n       Let  me   turn   now   to   a  fuller\nexplanation of the critical aspect of this\ncase, the confidentiality agreement that\ngave rise to this dispute.      You remember\nthat under the terms of the confidentiality\nagreement, [BWC] promised not to use for\nfive years, at least not without [FMI’s]\nexpress written approval, any information\ndisclosed by FMI at the May 11, 1990 meeting\nthat was \"confidential, proprietary, or\nnovel.\"\n\n       The kinds of information that could be\nconsidered   confidential,   proprietary   or\nnovel were, as you will see in the\nagreement, very broadly defined.          The\nagreement,   however,    allowed   for   [an]\nexception[].\n\n       The agreement did not apply to\notherwise protected information . . . if\n[BWC] could . . . [s]how that such\ninformation, in its disclosed combinations,\nwas in the public domain through no fault of\n[BWC].\n\n          *          *           *\n\n       [T]he   parties   recognized   that\ninformation,  if   in  the  form   it  was\ndisclosed, was already public knowledge,\neven if one or both of the parties was\nunaware of the fact, [it] could not be\n\n\n                    -20-\n\fdeemed confidential even if the agreement\ndefined it as such.\n\n          *          *           *\n\n       [BWC thus could] make use of any\ninformation that was already in the public\ndomain or became so through no fault of\n[BWC].\n\n       \"Public domain\" is a legal term of\nart, but it refers to information that is\ngenerally known to the public at large or\nthe people in a particular trade or business\nor could be obtained by an interested person\nwith   reasonable   ease  from   information\npublicly available.\n\n          *          *           *\n\n       The term \"confidential,\" as used in\nthe agreement, means information of a\nprivate nature that is entrusted to a third\nparty with the expectation that it will be\nkept secret.      \"Novel\" means something\ndifferent from anything ever seen or known\nbefore.     \"Proprietary\" refers to some\nprotectable     ownership    interest    in\ninformation.\n\n       Obviously, the term \"confidential\" has\na broader meaning in the [sic] than the\nterms \"novel\" and \"proprietary,\" and it is\nthe term that the parties have focused upon.\n\n       The test of whether information is, in\nfact, confidential has both an objective and\nsubjective component.\n\n       The test is objective in the sense\nthat the information must be of the kind\nthat a reasonable person would recognize as\nexclusive or private and likely to be known\nor appreciated only by its possession, even\nif it does not amount to a \"secret\" in the\npopular sense of the word.\n\n                    -21-\n\f                Information that is, on the other\n         hand, readily known or knowable to the\n         interest of the public cannot, as I have\n         said,   be  made  confidential   simply by\n         slapping it with a restrictive label.\n\n                The test is subjective in the sense\n         that the party imparting the information\n         must manifest an expectation that it will be\n         kept private by the person to whom it is\n         conveyed.\n\n                One obvious measure of whether a party\n         truly regards information as confidential is\n         the extent to which it takes diligent\n         precautions to safeguard the information\n         from inadvertent dissemination or improper\n         use by others.\n\n                To this point, it be apparent that\n         [FMI] has the burden of proving by a\n         preponderance of the evidence, that, one,\n         confidential information was disclosed to\n         [BWC] at the May 11, 1990 meeting and, that,\n         two, [BWC] made use of that information in\n         developing its flexible lance.\n\n         As we have suggested, BWC ignores these instructions\n\nand, citing to Massachusetts trade secrets law, contends that\n\nFMI’s hose was not subject to protection under the agreement\n\nbecause it was an obvious solution to the engineering problem\n\nposed by the Canadian project.   In so arguing, BWC highlights\n\nthe following uncontested evidence:   (1) the idea of combining\n\nKevlar and urethane (used as an adhesive but not a coating) was\n\ndisclosed in two pre-1988 hose patents, and the same combination\n\nwas advertised by another hose company in 1989; (2) FMI engineer\n\n\n                             -22-\n\fBoyce acknowledged on cross-examination that \"the simple idea of\n\ncombining polyurethane as a matrix with Kevlar fibers\" was not\n\na secret; and (3) BWC’s liability expert – the only formally\n\ndesignated liability expert to testify in the case – asserted\n\nthat the FMI hose was based on well-known engineering principles\n\nand materials in common use, and could easily have been designed\n\nby \"an engineer using principles available in 1990 and using\n\nwell-established technology.\"          BWC also points to the fact that\n\nLeary provided St. Louis with the address of U.S. Composites\n\nafter the May 11, 1990 meeting, asking why FMI would so freely\n\nshare this information if it were truly a trade secret.\n\n            If a properly instructed jury had found that BWC had\n\nmisappropriated an FMI trade secret under Massachusetts law, a\n\nsufficiency challenge to the verdict might well present a close\n\nquestion.     But here, the jury was not asked to make such a\n\nfinding.     Instead, after being told without objection that\n\n\"confidential\" information has \"a broader meaning\" than \"novel\"\n\nor \"proprietary\" information, the jury merely was asked to\n\ndecide whether (1) there had been a disclosure of information\n\nthat   a   \"reasonable   person   would      recognize   as   exclusive   or\n\nprivate and likely to be known or appreciated only by its\n\npossession, even if it does not amount to a ‘secret’ in the\n\npopular    sense   of   the   word\";   (2)   FMI   had   \"manifest[ed]    an\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fexpectation that [such information would] be kept private by\n\n[BWC]\";        and    (3)    the   information,          \"in   its    disclosed\n\ncombinations,\" was, through no fault of BWC, \"known to the\n\npublic    at    large   or   the   people    in   [the    relevant]     trade    or\n\nbusiness or could be obtained by an interested person with\n\nreasonable ease from information publicly available.\"\n\n               With respect to the first question, the jury reasonably\n\ncould have found that, prior to May 11, 1990, there was no\n\ngenerally available hose small, strong, and flexible enough for\n\nthe Canadian application.           The jury also reasonably could have\n\nfound that, during the May 11, 1990 meeting, FMI disclosed to\n\nBWC that it had developed such a hose; that the hose was\n\nconstructed from a unique \"recipe\" involving a nylon core, a\n\ndouble-braided sheath of Kevlar, and a polyurethane coating; and\n\nthat U.S. Composites had successfully manufactured the hose.\n\nFinally, the jury reasonably could have found that the hose was\n\nthe culmination of nearly two years of research and development,\n\nand that the hose would give FMI a significant leg up in bidding\n\non Ontario Hydro’s sludge removal business, which the utility\n\nclearly regarded as an urgent and time-sensitive problem.                        If\n\nindeed the jury made these permissible findings, it was entitled\n\nto conclude that a reasonable person would regard FMI’s hose\n\ntechnology       as   both   likely   to    be    appreciated    only    by     its\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fpossession and something FMI would have wanted to keep from its\n\nonly competitor for the sludge removal contracts.\n\n            With respect to the second question, the very fact that\n\nFMI compelled BWC and U.S. Composites to sign confidentiality\n\nagreements prior to making any disclosures allowed the jury to\n\nconclude that FMI had manifested a subjective expectation that\n\nthe hose technology would be kept confidential.                   In so ruling,\n\nwe acknowledge that Leary’s openness with St. Louis at and after\n\nthe May 11, 1990 meeting seems to undermine FMI’s claim that it\n\nregarded    as    confidential     the   information          disclosed   in   the\n\nLeary/St. Louis conversations.            But in the end, we think that\n\nthe jury reasonably could have regarded Leary’s disclosures as\n\nunusual revelations of protected information during an unusual\n\nperiod of cooperation between competitors, made more freely\n\nbecause    of    Leary’s   knowledge     of    the    signed    confidentiality\n\nagreement.\n\n            Finally, with respect to the third question, we believe\n\nthat the jury reasonably could have found that the information\n\nLeary related to St. Louis at the May 11, 1990 meeting was\n\nneither    known    within   the   hose       industry    \"in    its   disclosed\n\ncombinations\"      nor     obtainable     from       public    information     with\n\nreasonable ease.         In making its public domain argument, BWC\n\nunderstandably focuses on the fact that, generally speaking,\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fthere was at the relevant point in time nothing secret about\n\nconstructing a hose with a nylon core, a Kevlar braid, and\n\npolyurethane.    But nothing in the instructions required the jury\n\nto decide the public domain issue at this level of generality.\n\nRather, we think that, as instructed, the jury was entitled ask\n\nitself a much more specific question: On May 11, 1990, could an\n\ninterested party have learned with reasonable ease from publicly\n\navailable information that there existed a polyurethane-coated,\n\nKevlar-reinforced    nylon   hose   that   was   small,   strong,   and\n\nflexible enough to remove sludge within even the tiny gaps\n\nbetween the tube bundles in Canadian nuclear reactors?              The\n\nevidence is more than sufficient to sustain the jury’s negative\n\nresponse.\n\n            Having disposed of BWC’s primary argument, we turn to\n\nits alternative challenges to the district court’s denial of its\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law.      BWC’s first alternative\n\nargument is that, even if FMI disclosed confidential information\n\non May 11, 1990, BWC never \"used\" the information in violation\n\nof the agreement because BWC engineers did not \"incorporate\" the\n\ninformation into the BWC hose.      (BWC Brief at 35.)    We recognize\n\nthat, in addressing BWC’s motion, the trial judge accepted that\n\nincorporation was the standard by which the jury should have\n\ngauged whether there had been an unlawful use.            See Foster-\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fMiller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Canada, No. 93-12465-RGS, at 6-\n\n7 (D. Mass. December 31, 1998) (memorandum of decision and order\n\non defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law).                     The\n\ncourt reached this conclusion because, in its opinion, FMI had\n\nargued   exclusively    at   trial    that    there   had    been    such    an\n\nincorporation.     See id.   But even if we shared the lower court’s\n\nview of the trial record, we would disagree with its conclusion.\n\nTheories presented in opening and closing arguments do not\n\nnecessarily curb a jury’s discretion in this way.             As we already\n\nhave stated, a jury verdict will stand so long as the evidence\n\nmakes it reasonable under \"any permissible claim or theory.\"\n\nCollazo-Santiago, 149 F.3d at 27 (emphasis supplied).               Here, the\n\njury was not asked to find incorporation; it more broadly was\n\nasked,   without   objection   from    BWC,    whether      BWC   \"used\"    the\n\ninformation in violation of the agreement.                  BWC cannot now\n\ncomplain that the jury may have understood the term \"use\" in its\n\nordinary sense.\n\n          So viewed, the use issue is not close.                    There was\n\nabundant evidence that BWC developed its hose far more quickly\n\nthan otherwise would have been possible because it started with\n\nand proceeded from the knowledge that a viable hose could be\n\nconstructed from nylon, Kevlar, and polyurethane.                   Moreover,\n\nthere was evidence from which the jury reasonably could have\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\ffound that BWC \"used\" the May 11, 1990 disclosure of U.S.\n\nComposites as the hose manufacturer to obtain an FMI hose sample\n\nfrom   U.S.    Composites,    test   the    sample,    and   apply   the   test\n\nresults   in     developing   its    own    hose.      Thus,   the   evidence\n\nadequately supported the jury’s conclusion that BWC wrongfully\n\nused the confidential information disclosed on May 11, 1990.\n\n\n\n              Pointing to evidence that Ontario Hydro in fact owned\n\nthe hose technology at issue in this case, BWC next contends\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion\n\nthat the technology was proprietary to FMI under Massachusetts\n\nlaw.   In BWC’s view, one cannot protect under a confidentiality\n\nagreement that which one does not own.                BWC did not, however,\n\npresent this argument to the lower court when it moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law.         Accordingly, we deem the argument\n\nwaived.   See, e.g., Hammond v. T.J. Litle & Co., Inc., 82 F.3d\n\n1166, 1171 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              Finally, BWC argues that it should prevail because FMI\n\ndid not formally designate an expert to testify as to liability\n\nissues.   More particularly, BWC takes the position that expert\n\ntestimony was required for the jury rationally to have answered\n\nwhether (1) the \"combination of materials [in the FMI hose was]\n\nan idea so unique that an engineer with the appropriate training\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fand experience could . . . readily discover it\"; and (2) \"BWC\n\nhad incorporated aspects of the FMI hose that were proprietary\n\nto FMI.\"      (BWC Brief at 47-48 (emphasis in original)).             But as\n\nwe have explained, these questions – which again are based on\n\nthe premise that the jury was instructed in strict accordance\n\nwith Massachusetts trade secrets law (or at least BWC’s view of\n\nsuch law) – were not questions that the instructions required\n\nthe jury to answer.         Based on our review of the record as a\n\nwhole, we are satisfied that competent evidence supports the\n\njury’s verdict.\n\n           2. Admission in Evidence of Lichtman Notes and Failure\n\n           to Give Curative Instruction\n\n           BWC asserts that the district court erred in admitting\n\nthe Lichtman notes in evidence, and then exacerbated its error\n\nby   failing to give a curative instruction after FMI, in arguing\n\nto the jury during its closing that its hose was not an obvious\n\nextension of existing technology, used the Lichtman notes in a\n\nmanner prohibited by the hearsay rule.                 See Fed. R. Evid. 802\n\n(prohibiting the introduction of hearsay evidence).                  In BWC’s\n\nview,   the    court’s     failure    to    give   a   curative   instruction\n\neffectively permitted FMI to use inadmissible double hearsay as\n\nsubstantive expert testimony on a crucial liability issue.                 FMI\n\nresponds      that   the   Lichtman        notes   were   admitted   for   two\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fpermissible non-hearsay purposes – (1) to show what information\n\nBabbitt and Leary had when they conducted their hose searches;\n\nand (2) to show the falsity of the vendors’ impressions, see\n\nUnited States v. Adkins, 741 F.2d 744, 746 (5th Cir. 1984) (\"When\n\nstatements are introduced to prove the falsity of the matter\n\nasserted, they are not inadmissible as hearsay.\") – and, in any\n\nevent, were properly admitted as a business record.           See Fed. R.\n\nEvid.   803(6)   (setting   forth    the    \"[r]ecords   of    regularly\n\nconducted business activity\" hearsay exception).\n\n          FMI successfully moved the Lichtman notes in evidence\n\nduring its direct examination of Chip Babbitt.         After overruling\n\nBWC’s objection to admission of the notes, and in response to\n\nBWC’s   subsequent   request   for   a     limiting   instruction,   the\n\ndistrict court addressed the jury as follows:\n\n                 Jurors, if I can anticipate what\n          [BWC’s counsel] is asking me to tell you\n          with respect to this last exhibit, the man –\n          that is, Mr. Lichtman – who prepared these\n          notes upon which this witness relied,\n          because of medical problems, is unavailable\n          to testify.\n\n                 He had a cerebral         hemorrhage so he\n          cannot come into court and       testify about the\n          circumstances under which        he prepared these\n          notes which contain a             fair amount of\n          hearsay.\n\n                 He is in the business of calling on\n          people and asking them certain questions\n          about the availability of this product.\n\n\n                                -30-\n\f                   I’m sure what [BWC’s counsel] wants me\n            to do is to point this out to you, that\n            while this witness [Chip Babbitt] may have\n            relied on these notes, we are in a position\n            today, even though I’ve admitted them as\n            evidence, of not being able to go back to\n            their author to really explore the manner in\n            which these notes were assembled.\n\nWhen asked if this was what BWC’s counsel had in mind in\n\nrequesting the limiting instruction, counsel informed the court:\n\n\"It is exactly, your Honor.\"              FMI then went on to question\n\nBabbitt about the particulars of his hose search, asking whether\n\nand   why   Babbitt   did   or   did    not   contact   vendors   with   whom\n\nLichtman previously had spoken.\n\n            The context in which the notes were admitted, the\n\ncourt’s admonition that the notes contain \"a fair amount of\n\nhearsay,\" and the court’s two explicit references to Babbitt\n\nrelying on the notes, combine to suggest that the court did not\n\nadmit the Lichtman notes as evidence tending to prove the truth\n\nof the matters asserted therein.          Instead, these factors make it\n\nfar more likely that the notes were admitted for the limited\n\npurpose of helping to establish the factual context in which\n\nBabbitt began his hose search.           Admission of the notes for this\n\nlimited purpose would not have violated the hearsay rule and\n\ntherefore would have been within the court’s discretion.                  See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(c) (defining hearsay as a \"statement, other\n\nthan one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial, or\n\n                                       -31-\n\fhearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserted\").     Moreover, even if the court admitted the notes for\n\na different purpose, the fact that the notes were admissible for\n\nthe   purpose   just   described   is     sufficient   to    support   their\n\nconsideration by a properly instructed jury.                See LaBarre v.\n\nShepard, 84 F.3d 496, 500-01 (1 st Cir. 1996) (\"[W]e can affirm\n\nthe admission of evidence on any proper basis, even if the trial\n\njudge relied on a different ground.\").\n\n          Of course, whether the notes conceivably could have\n\ncome into evidence for a proper purpose is a different question\n\nfrom whether the court permitted FMI to use them improperly.\n\nAnd it is on this latter issue that BWC primarily focuses its\n\nappellate argument.       In particular, BWC complains about the\n\nfollowing passage from FMI’s closing argument:\n\n                 What [FMI] did in 1988 was they called\n          the leading hose companies in the world and\n          said, This is our problem, do you have an\n          answer, which is the way it works in real\n          life.\n\n                 And what we found out was two things:\n          First of all, the top guy in the world,\n          Rogan, from Rogan & Shanley, other vendors\n          refer to Rogan & Shanley as the prime source\n          for small-diameter high-pressure hose, spoke\n          to Lichtman twice.\n\n                 He said there are technical problems\n          which Rogan feels may be insuperable at\n          almost any price.   In short, Rogan thinks\n          we’re wasting our time.        People told\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\f            Columbus       he     shouldn’t    have    sailed       to\n            America.\n\nBWC   contends     that    this    portion     of   FMI’s    closing     argument\n\neffectively converted Rogan’s out-of-court statement (as related\n\nby    the   non-testifying         Lichtman)    into    substantive       expert\n\ntestimony    that    the    hose    FMI   developed    was    not   an   obvious\n\nextension of extant, publicly known hose technology.\n\n            BWC’s contention fails to take account, however, of the\n\nunusual procedural posture in which this issue comes before us.\n\nBWC did not object to this argument when it was made.                         It\n\ninstead brought the issue up at the sidebar conference following\n\nthe court’s jury instructions, when it asked the district court\n\nto repeat its earlier limiting instruction:\n\n                   [BWC’s Counsel]: Your honor, [FMI’s\n            counsel] again emphasized the importance of\n            the Lichtman notes in his closing, and we\n            would ask for another cautionary instruction\n            on the hearsay nature of this document.\n\n                   The Court: If he did emphasize it, it\n            [e]luded me completely.\n\n                   [BWC’s Counsel]: Your Honor, what\n            [FMI’s counsel] did was to take the hearsay\n            portions of those notes, Mr. Rogan, what Mr.\n            Rogan said about this being an impossible\n            task, and used those as expert testimony\n            where, in fact, Mr. Rogan was not before the\n            Court.\n\n                     The Court: Yes.\n\n                     [BWC’s Counsel]: We understood those\n            were    only admitted to show this was the\n\n                                      -33-\n\f            beginning of a hose search and Mr. Rogan –\n            anything of a hearsay nature about what Mr.\n            Rogan believed about the difficulty would\n            not come in as expert testimony.\n\n                   The Court: Well, I just want to call\n            attention to specific – I’m just going to\n            have to trust that the jury will understand\n            that they have to follow my instructions\n            limiting,   excluding,   and   disregarding\n            evidence.\n\nThus,   the      question   is    not    whether    the    court      should       have\n\ninstructed the jury to disregard FMI’s counsel’s argument; it is\n\nonly whether, in light of unobjected-to interceding events, the\n\ncourt should have repeated its earlier instruction to the effect\n\nthat the Lichtman notes should only be considered for limited,\n\nnon-hearsay purposes.        The court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndeclining to repeat what it already had said.\n\n            3.    Remaining Arguments\n\n            BWC’s    remaining     arguments       do   not    require       extended\n\ndiscussion.         BWC   first   complains      that     the    district       court\n\ncommitted     reversible    error       in   instructing       the    jury    on   the\n\nweighing of \"differ[ing]\" expert testimony because FMI presented\n\nno   expert   testimony     as    to    liability.        In    rejecting       BWC’s\n\nchallenge to its instruction, the court stated that it had given\n\nthe instruction to guide the jury with respect to the differing\n\ntestimony given by each side’s damages expert.                       The court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in so reasoning.\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\f            BWC next asserts that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to evaluate BWC’s motion to exclude FMI’s damages expert\n\nunder the reliability standard set forth in Daubert v. Merrell\n\nDow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), and refined in Kumho Tire\n\nCo., 526 U.S. 137.           BWC also contends that, had the court\n\nperformed    a   Daubert     analysis,       it   would    have    excluded    the\n\ntestimony.\n\n            In arguing that the district court failed to assess\n\nwhether    FMI’s   damages    expert’s       testimony     \"both    rests     on   a\n\nreliable    foundation     and   is   relevant      to    the   task   at   hand,\"\n\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 597, BWC wrests out of context the court’s\n\nstatement that the proposed testimony \"raises no issues . . .\n\nthat . . . implicate[] the rule of Daubert.\"                The statement BWC\n\nrelies upon is more fairly evaluated in full context:\n\n                   With respect to the testimony of [each\n            side’s   damages  expert],    I’ve  had   the\n            opportunity last night to review the reports\n            and exhibits that I was provided . . . .\n\n                   [FMI’s damages expert’s] report, to my\n            mind, raises no issues of unconventional\n            hypothesis or unorthodox methodology that,\n            in my mind, implicates the rule of Daubert\n            v. Dow Pharmaceuticals . . . .\n\n                   I don’t find that these differences\n            [between each side’s experts’ proposed\n            testimony], again, raise any of the kind of\n            concerns that Daubert addresses, nor do I\n            find anything about the credentials of\n            either economist that would cause me to\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\f            doubt that they are unqualified               to    give\n            testimony of this kind.\n\n                   Rather, the conflict[s] between the\n            two views [are] the ordinary sorts of\n            differences that I encounter all the time\n            between economists over issues like this\n            which, to some degree, are speculative and\n            have to be speculative because you’re\n            talking about events that did not occur,\n            about a future that hasn’t been revealed.\n\n                   So I think that I’m not going to allow\n            the motion to hold . . . .\n\n                   If there is a fundamental difficulty\n            that emerges with either expert’s testimony,\n            I’ll handle that in a more conventional\n            method by simply striking or telling the\n            jury to disregard that aspect of the\n            testimony.\n\n            In our view, this passage makes clear that the district\n\ncourt   evaluated    the    proposed    testimony   for    reliability         and\n\nconcluded that it was sufficiently reliable for admission in\n\nevidence.    We thus reject BWC’s claim that the court did not\n\nevaluate the testimony under Daubert.            And having rejected the\n\nargument    that   the     court   improperly    failed    to    perform       its\n\ngatekeeping function under Daubert, we also reject as based on\n\na faulty factual premise the argument that the court would have\n\nexcluded plaintiff’s damages expert’s testimony had it applied\n\nDaubert.     In    reaching    this    latter   conclusion,      we    think    it\n\nsignificant that BWC has not here challenged the damages verdict\n\nas based upon speculative or insufficiently reliable evidence\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fintroduced at trial.     Indeed, in connection with this issue,\n\nBWC’s brief makes no mention at all of the testimony FMI’s\n\ndamages expert gave at trial.\n\n         BWC’s final argument is that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in ordering that (1) certain documents produced\n\nby FMI during discovery \"be used only for purposes related to\n\nthe instant litigation\"; and (2) \"any notations made [by FMI] on\n\nthe documents after their creation be deleted.\"            The documents\n\nin question were all initially marked confidential by FMI and\n\nproduced under an agreed-to protective order which limited the\n\nparties’ ability to use materials so marked.          BWC alleges that\n\nthe documents demonstrate \"that FMI had, on numerous occasions,\n\ngained unauthorized access to information about BWC’s sludge\n\nlance designs and financial information, in some instances by\n\ntaking it from desks of Ontario Hydro employees or directly off\n\nOntario Hydro’s facsimile machines.\"           (BWC Brief at 20.)      BWC\n\ndoes not suggest that the court’s order hampered its trial\n\npreparation.   Rather,   BWC   appears    interested      in   using   the\n\nmaterials for purposes unrelated to this litigation.\n\n         Whatever   merit   there      might    be   to   BWC’s   claimed\n\nentitlement to use as it sees fit the documents, complete with\n\nFMI’s notations thereon, the fact is that BWC never argued such\n\nan entitlement to the district court.      These documents only were\n\n\n                                -37-\n\fbrought to the lower court’s attention by means of BWC’s \"Motion\n\nto    Remove   Confidential        Designations   from    Certain       Documents\n\nProduced by Plaintiffs,\" which the court granted subject to the\n\nrestrictions noted above.            In that motion, BWC asserted only\n\nthat the inaccurate confidential designations were hampering its\n\ntrial preparation efforts; it in no way argued an entitlement to\n\nuse    the     materials     for     non-litigation       related       purposes.\n\nMoreover,      BWC   never    asked     the   court      to       reconsider     the\n\nrestrictions, which were imposed in response to FMI submissions\n\nexpressing concern that BWC intended to use the materials for\n\nsuch purposes (which submissions BWC did not oppose on grounds\n\nof entitlement to use the material for such purposes).                         Under\n\nthe circumstances, we regard the argument BWC presses here as\n\nwaived.      See, e.g., National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,\n\n43 F.3d 731, 749 (1st Cir. 1995) (arguments not presented below\n\nare waived).\n\nC.    FMI’s Appeal\n\n             1.   Denial of Motion for New Trial on Damages\n\n             In   March    1994,     FMI   established        a     wholly     owned\n\nsubsidiary named Foster-Miller Canada (FMC) to compete for water\n\nlancing contracts in Canada.          During discovery, FMI acknowledged\n\nthat FMC, and not FMI, would have bid on any post-March 1994\n\ncontracts wrongfully won by BWC as a result of its breach of the\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\fconfidentiality        agreement.          FMI’s    damages    expert,       without\n\nexplaining      why,   included      FMC’s    projected       lost    profits      in\n\narriving   at    the   FMI    damages      calculations       set   forth    in   his\n\nreport.    Prior to trial, BWC moved in limine to preclude FMI\n\nfrom presenting evidence of FMC’s lost profits, arguing that FMI\n\nalone was the plaintiff and that FMI was not entitled to profits\n\nthat   would    have   gone    to    its    wholly   owned     subsidiary.        In\n\nopposition, FMI simply asserted that \"the law thoroughly and\n\nindisputably establishes that a parent/stockholder ([FMI]) can\n\nrecover damages to a subsidiary/corporation ([FMC]) flowing from\n\nbreach    of   an   agreement       with    the    parent/stockholder         (BWC’s\n\nagreement with [FMI]) . . . .\" The district court agreed with\n\nBWC and barred FMI from presenting testimony regarding FMC’s\n\nlost profits.\n\n           Following the verdict, FMI moved for a partial new\n\ntrial on damages, arguing for the first time that it had been\n\nentitled to FMC’s lost profits because such profits accurately\n\nmeasured the diminution in the value of FMC caused by BWC’s\n\nconduct: \"FMI was a 100% shareholder of [FMC, and] profits lost\n\nby [FMC] translated, dollar for dollar, into a loss to [FMI]\n\nbecause of the loss in the value of its ownership interest in\n\n[FMC].\"    (FMI’s Motion for Partial New Trial at 4.)                       In other\n\nwords, rather than simply asserting an entitlement to its wholly\n\n\n                                       -39-\n\fowned subsidiary’s lost profits (as it had done prior to trial),\n\nFMI now was asserting both an entitlement to the diminution in\n\nvalue of its wholly owned asset, and that the asset’s lost\n\nprofits accurately measured such diminution.                        In a margin order,\n\nthe district court rejected this theory as, inter alia, \"raised\n\ntoo late in the game.\"            (Id. at 1.)\n\n            On    appeal,      FMI       renews      its   claimed        entitlement           to\n\nrecover the diminished value of BWC.                       In so arguing, FMI once\n\nagain asserts that BWC’s lost profits are the proper measure of\n\nsuch diminution.          But even if we assume arguendo that FMI was\n\nentitled    to    recover      FMC’s       diminished        value       as    part       of   its\n\ndamages,    we     think      that       the   \"FMC’s       lost     profits          =    FMC’s\n\ndiminished value\" premise of FMI’s argument is sufficiently\n\ndebatable    to        have   required         its    disclosure         to     BWC       during\n\ndiscovery.       Clearly, lost profits and diminished corporate value\n\nare distinct concepts, see, e.g., Protectors Ins. Service, Inc.\n\nv. United States Fidelity & Guar. Co., 132 F.3d 612, 617-18 (10th\n\nCir. 1998), and we are not prepared to say that the measure of\n\ndiminished       corporate     value       will      always       meet    or    exceed         the\n\nmeasure of the corporation’s lost profits.                        Had FMI afforded BWC\n\nnotice that it was seeking FMC’s lost profits as a measure of\n\nFMC’s   diminished        value,         BWC   would       have    been       afforded         the\n\nopportunity       to    develop      a    competing        valuation          theory.          The\n\n\n                                           -40-\n\fdistrict court’s decision to reject FMI’s theory as untimely was\n\nthus within its discretion.\n\n          2.    Discovery Sanction\n\n          During discovery, BWC served upon FMI a Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 30(b)(6) deposition notice covering fourteen topics.             FMI did\n\nnot produce witnesses competent to testify as to five of the\n\ntopics because BWC had in the early stages of the case already\n\ndeposed the employees FMI regarded as most knowledgeable on\n\nthose topics.    Instead, with respect to these five topics, FMI’s\n\ncounsel wrote BWC’s counsel and asked him to specify whether he\n\nwanted   FMI   (1)   to   recall   these    witnesses;   (2)   to   produce\n\nadditional witnesses; or (3) to designate the prior deposition\n\ntestimony as Rule 30(b)(6) testimony.            BWC subsequently moved\n\nfor an order compelling FMI to comply with its Rule 30(b)(6)\n\ndeposition notice, which the district court granted.            The court\n\nalso awarded BWC the costs and fees it incurred in bringing the\n\nmotion to compel.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d) (requiring an award\n\nof costs and fees upon the granting of such a motion \"unless the\n\ncourt finds that the failure was substantially justified or that\n\nother circumstances make an award of expenses unjust\").\n\n          On appeal, FMI argues that its conduct was reasonable\n\nunder the circumstances and that the district court’s sanction\n\nwas an abuse of its discretion.            But our review of the record\n\n\n                                   -41-\n\freveals that the court had reason to conclude that FMI, by\n\nasking BWC whom it wished to testify on behalf of FMI for Rule\n\n30(b)(6) purposes (or what testimony it wished FMI to designate\n\nas Rule 30(b)(6) testimony), effectively attempted to shift to\n\nBWC the onus of identifying who best spoke for FMI on the\n\nmatters in question.         Such a burden shift is contrary to the\n\npurposes of Rule 30(b)(6).        See Mistui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. v.\n\nPuerto Rico Water Resources Auth., 93 F.R.D. 62,            66-67 (D.P.R.\n\n1981).     In any event, FMI cannot and does not deny that,\n\nstrictly   speaking,    it   failed   either    to   designate    witnesses\n\ncompetent to address each of the topics specified in the Rule\n\n30(b)(6) notice or to obtain from the court an appropriate\n\nprotective order.      The court thus did not abuse its discretion\n\nin strictly enforcing Rule 30(b)(6).        See id.      Nor did the court\n\nabuse its discretion in concluding that FMI’s failure to comply\n\nwith the notice was not \"substantially justified\" within the\n\nmeaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d).\n\n                                   III.\n\n           For   the   reasons   stated,   we   affirm    the    orders   and\n\njudgments appealed from in all respects.\n\n           Affirmed.    No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\f",

(FMI). The breach sued upon was BWC's alleged use of confidential FMI technology in the development of a small diameter, high pressure, flexible hose. The jury set FMI's damages at $5,084,587. BWC appeals from an interlocutory order denying one of its discovery motions, the judgment entered pursuant to the jury's verdict, and the judgment entered pursuant to a memorandum and order denying its post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law. BWC's principal claim is one of evidentiary insufficiency. FMI cross-appeals from orders sanctioning it for a discovery abuse and denying its motion for a partial new trial on damages. We affirm in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case already has been the subject of three published opinions. See 46 F.3d 138 (1st Cir. 1995) (vacating and remanding 848 F. Supp. 271 (D. Mass. 1994)); 975 F. Supp. 30 (D. Mass. 1997). We therefore eschew a comprehensive recitation of the litigation and confine our present focus to matters relevant to these appeals. In doing so, we sometimes defer more detailed descriptions of pertinent events to our discussions of the specific arguments advanced. And as in any case that challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we present the historical facts as the jury might have found them, consistent with the record but in a light most favorable to the verdict. See, e.g., Grajales-Romero v. American Airlines Inc., 194 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1980s, both FMI and BWC became involved in the business of cleaning nuclear powered steam generators. Impurities in the water boiled off in a nuclear generator leave on the generator's bundled tubes an often extremely hard sediment called \"sludge.\" Over time, sludge deposits corrode and wear away the tubes. Sludge-generated corrosion is a major problem in nuclear generators. If unchecked, it can lead to radioactive leaks and astronomically expensive plant shutdowns needed to effectuate repairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1980s, FMI and BWC were the only two companies engaged in the business of \"sludge lancing.\" Sludge lancing flushes away accumulated sludge on a generator's tubes with a thin stream of pressurized water delivered through a high pressure hose encased within a metal water lance. By the late 1980s, BWC had developed a manual sludge lancing system for cleaning the nuclear generators of Ontario Hydro, a Canadian public utility. The relationship between BWC and Ontario Hydro was longstanding; BWC had designed Ontario Hydro's generators. But because the water lance and stainless steel reinforced hose in BWC's system were insufficiently flexible to maneuver into more than half of the many nooks and crannies between and among the tube bundles in Ontario Hydro's generators, the tubes - which are significantly closer together in Canadian generators than in the typical United States commercial generator - were caked with a disconcerting amount of unreachable sludge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, by the late 1980s, FMI had developed a robotically controlled \"flexlance\" sludge removal system. As initially designed, FMI's lance contained a stainless steel braided hose flexible enough to bend 90 degrees. This flexibility permitted the lance to enter the relatively wide gaps between and among the tubes in United States commercial generators for purposes of sludge removal. In 1988, FMI began research into adapting its flexlance system for use on the steam generators used in United States Navy nuclear powered vessels. The adaptation process was not straightforward because, like the Canadian generators, the naval generators had significantly smaller inter-tube gaps than United States commercial generators, and the lance and hose developed for use in the commercial generators would not fit into these narrower spaces. Thus, in August 1988, FMI began research into one of the central problems of the adaption process and the problem at the heart of this lawsuit: acquiring or developing a hose small enough (.125 inch outer diameter) to maneuver into the tube gaps in the naval generators, strong enough to withstand the very high burst pressures (10,000 pounds per square inch) needed for effective sludge removal, and yet flexible enough to bend up to 90 degrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, FMI retained an outside consultant, Philip Lichtman, to look into whether such a hose might be available from a commercial hose vendor. Lichtman did not testify at trial, but notes he made in connection with his hose search (which were admitted into evidence over BWC's objection) suggested that his search was unsuccessful. The following is an excerpt from the so-called Lichtman notes that is particularly important to this appeal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Time after time, other vendors refer to Rogan &amp; Shanley as the prime source for small-diameter high pressure hose. I spoke with Dr. Rogan twice . . . . [T]here are technical problems which Rogan feels may be virtually insuperable at almost any price. In short, Rogan thinks [FMI] is wasting [its] time; that only [insufficiently flexible] metal tube will do the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other sections, the Lichtman notes indicate that a second vendor also had described the project as \"insuperable,\" and that a third vendor had thought developing such a small, strong, and flexible hose would be \"very difficult.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1988, an FMI engineer named Chip Babbitt conducted a second commercial hose search. Babbitt used Lichtman's notes as a starting point and followed up with several of the vendors Lichtman previously had contacted. Like Lichtman, Babbitt had no luck finding a commercial hose suitable for the naval application. He then mentioned his problem to another FMI engineer, Jay Boyce. Boyce suggested that a hose with a Kevlar braid reinforcement be used. Kevlar is a strong and flexible fiber, but it is highly susceptible to fraying. Boyce also suggested that Babbitt discuss his problem with Glenn Freitas, an FMI engineer who had experience with fiber braiding. Freitas concurred in Boyce's Kevlar suggestion and further recommended that the braided Kevlar be coated with an elastomeric matrix (i.e., a flexible coating typically made from rubber or plastic) to protect the Kevlar from abrasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Babbitt began to look for a company that could manufacture a hose of the size and strength needed for the Navy project. In the fall of 1988, Babbitt wrote to a number of hose manufacturers. In his letters, he set forth the size, flexibility, and pressure requirements of the contemplated hose. Although the letters explicitly mentioned the possibility of using stainless steel to reinforce the hose (the approach advocated by many of the manufacturers Babbitt had contacted during his hose search), the letters also suggested that the hose might be constructed with a flexible nylon core, reinforced with a Kevlar overbraid, and coated with a flexible elastomeric matrix \"such as a urethane.\" One of the companies Babbitt contacted at this time was U.S. Composites, a braiding company that had not previously been involved in designing or manufacturing hoses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1988, FMI commissioned U.S. Composites and another manufacturer to create some Kevlar hose samples in the event a suitable stainless steel reinforced hose could not be designed. In January 1989, U.S. Composites shipped FMI a set of uncoated Kevlar-braided hose samples, which FMI found to be \"among the most promising\" of the hose prototypes then available. In February 1989, Daniel Fischbach, another FMI engineer, replaced Babbitt on the hose development project. The following month, although FMI was still experimenting with a stainless steel reinforced hose, FMI and U.S. Composites entered into a contract under which U.S. Composites would continue to manufacture and supply to FMI hose samples with Kevlar overbraids. This contract, along with two other FMI/U.S. Composites contracts covering the emerging naval hose technology, contained a confidentiality agreement designed to protect the emerging technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring and summer of 1989, FMI tested a number of Kevlar-wrapped hose samples and experienced problems with bursting. Throughout this time, FMI was still contemplating whether to protect the Kevlar by coating it with a matrix such as urethane or by surrounding it with a separate outside cover. By fall, FMI was leaning towards a coated, coverless hose and had U.S. Composites experimentally coat its samples with various types of urethanes and epoxies. By December 1989, U.S. Composites had generated samples of hose using a number of different coating materials. Eventually, FMI chose for the Navy project a hose with a nylon core, a single layer of Kevlar braid, and a urethane coating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, back in 1988, after FMI had begun work on the naval project, Ontario Hydro approached FMI about the possibility of applying its flexlance technology to clean the tube bundles within its generators. Shortly thereafter, William Schneider of BWC called FMI and proposed that the two competitors cooperate, as each of the companies had information and technology that might prove useful in solving Ontario Hydro's sludge problem. Eventually, the companies submitted to Ontario Hydro separate proposals for jointly studying and addressing the problem. The companies did not share their proposals with each other, as each proposal contained confidential information. FMI subsequently entered into a separate agreement with Ontario Hydro to study the feasibility of using the flexlance system in Canadian generators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1990, FMI assigned William Leary, an engineer who had assisted in the completion of the Navy project, the task of obtaining a flexible hose for a lance to be used in the Canadian generators. The hose could be slightly larger (.200 inch outer diameter) than the Navy hose, but it required a greater pressure retention capacity. Like Lichtman and Babbitt, Leary first attempted to find a suitable commercial hose. Using Lichtman's and Babbitt's search notes as his starting point, Leary contacted twenty-five different manufacturers. His search was unsuccessful. Leary thus turned to the naval project engineers and asked how the Navy hose might be adapted to the Canadian application. The engineers agreed that wrapping a second layer of Kevlar around the hose might do the trick. Subsequently, FMI contacted U.S. Composites and asked it to create a hose similar to the Navy hose but with a double wrap of Kevlar. In early April 1990, U.S. Composites shipped samples of the requested hose to FMI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary's hose work proceeded as FMI was preparing its feasibility study for Ontario Hydro. On May 11, 1990, an Ontario Hydro representative agreed to travel to FMI's research and development facility in Waltham, Massachusetts, for a meeting to discuss the progress of the study. Ontario Hydro requested that a BWC engineer, Daniel St. Louis, also attend the meeting. St. Louis understood that he had been invited to provide input with respect to certain water lancing tests necessary to completion of the study. FMI agreed to St. Louis' presence but required BWC to execute a confidentiality agreement to protect confidential information that would be discussed at the meeting. In relevant part, the agreement provided that, for a period of five years, BWC would not \"use FMI's [confidential, proprietary or novel information] for any purpose unless specifically authorized in writing by FMI.\" The agreement also explicitly excluded from the definition of \"confidential, proprietary or novel information\" that which, \"in its disclosed combination[s], is in the public domain through no fault of [BWC].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meeting lasted the better part of the day, and St. Louis was excluded from a number of discussions involving sensitive FMI technology and information. But in a brief presentation towards the end of the meeting, Leary showed St. Louis a sample of the hose FMI was developing for the Canadian application. Leary told St. Louis that the hose had a nylon core, Kevlar-wrap, and urethane coating. Leary also informed St. Louis that U.S. Composites was manufacturing the hose for FMI. Unbeknownst to Leary and FMI, St. Louis was at the time spearheading an effort by BWC to develop a 90-degree flexible lance of its own. At some point after the meeting, St. Louis called Leary and obtained from him the address of U.S. Composites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, St. Louis contacted U.S. Composites and spoke with its president, Hugo Kruesi. St. Louis asked Kruesi if U.S. Composites could make for BWC \"a similar hose to that . . . provided for [FMI].\" In the course of several subsequent telephone conversations between Kruesi and St. Louis, Kruesi provided St. Louis with two price quotations and detailed information regarding the FMI hose's construction. St. Louis also obtained from U.S. Composites a sample of FMI's hose, which he subjected to analysis and testing. By the fall of 1990, however, Kruesi had become concerned that his interactions with BWC were violative of the confidentiality agreements between FMI and U.S. Composites. He thus telephoned FMI and asked whether there would be a problem if U.S. Composites were to produce a high pressure flexible hose for BWC. FMI asked Kruesi to hold off on manufacturing anything for BWC. Subsequently, BWC asked FMI for permission to develop a high pressure flexible hose through U.S. Composites, but FMI declined to grant such permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990, two months prior to the May 11 meeting at FMI, BWC had still been proposing sludge removal with the relatively inflexible stainless steel technology it had been using for years. It was not until April 1990, when Ontario Hydro suggested to it the need for a more flexible lance, that BWC even began to contemplate designing its own product capable of bending up to 90 degrees. And it was not until after the May 11 meeting, during the period of time that St. Louis initiated contacts with U.S. Composites, that BWC documented any research into the development of a such a product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 1990, BWC made its first proposal to Ontario Hydro to develop a water lance of sufficient size and strength to meet Ontario Hydro's sludge lancing needs yet capable of bending up to 90 degrees. The proposal specifically disclaimed any guarantee of success \"in view of the developmental nature of the work.\" At some point in the months that followed, BWC performed its own unsuccessful search for a commercial hose suitable for use in Canadian generators. During this same period of time, St. Louis also subjected the FMI hose sample to destructive testing. The FMI hose was the only sample St. Louis ever tested. By November 1990, BWC's flexible lance was complete \"except for the tubing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, at some point after its efforts to work with U.S. Composites had fallen through, BWC contracted with a Canadian company known as Barrday to manufacture its hose. As initially designed, the BWC hose, like the FMI hose, had a nylon core reinforced with a sheathing of urethane-coated and braided Kevlar. But it was different in many respects. Unlike the FMI hose, the BWC hose was not \"wet braided\"; it instead was pulled through a bucket of urethane (of a different type than that used by FMI) after the Kevlar had already been braided upon the hose. Moreover, the BWC hose had an outer abrasion cover. Finally, the BWC hose used thicker strands of Kevlar weaved onto the core tube at a somewhat different angle than that employed by FMI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the life of the FMI/BWC confidentiality agreement, Ontario Hydro sought bids on sixteen jobs requiring the contractor to perform sludge removal with a water lance flexible enough to bend 90 degrees. FMI successfully bid on one of these jobs; BWC won the other fifteen. At trial, FMI took the position that, but for BWC's wrongful use of confidential information regarding the FMI hose disclosed at the May 11, 1990 meeting, FMI would have won all sixteen contracts. FMI's theory was that BWC copied and then built upon FMI's basic hose design, the basic elements of which (along with the name of the hose's manufacturer) BWC ascertained from Leary's presentation at the meeting. FMI argued to the jury that this breach of the confidentiality agreement permitted BWC to enter the relevant market quickly enough to secure contracts that otherwise would have gone to FMI. The jury agreed and, as we have stated, set FMI's damages at just over five million dollars.

BWC also contends that the court erred in admitting the Lichtman notes in evidence and then compounded its error by failing to give a curative instruction after the notes were misused by FMI during its closing argument. Finally, BWC asserts that the court committed reversible error in instructing the jury on the weighing of expert testimony, in denying its motion in limine seeking to limit or exclude the testimony of FMI's damages expert, and in making certain FMI documents obtained by BWC during discovery the subject of a protective order. For its part, FMI argues that the court erred in declining to award it a new trial on damages after erroneously precluding it from introducing lost profits evidence relating to a Canadian subsidiary FMI established in 1994, and in sanctioning it for failing to comply with a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deposition notice served during discovery by BWC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of BWC's motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to FMI and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor. See, e.g., Collazo-Santiago v. Toyota Motor Corp., 149 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 1998). Our inquiry is whether the evidence, when viewed from this perspective, would \"permit a reasonable jury to find in favor of [FMI] on any permissible claim or theory.\" Id.

See, e.g., United States v. Cunan, 152 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir. 1998) (evidentiary rulings); Beatty v. Michael Bus. Machs. Corp., 172 F.3d 117, 121 (1st Cir. 1999) (decision whether the evidence warrants a particular jury instruction); Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 141-42 (1999) (decision whether to admit challenged expert testimony); United States v. Gilbert, 181 F.3d 152, 162 (1st Cir. 1999) (discovery rulings); Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. v. Constructora Lluch, Inc., 169 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir.) (denial of motion for new trial), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 175 (1999). We will not, however, uphold any decision within the court's discretion that has been tainted by an error of law. See, e.g., United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d 24, 31 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 129 (1999). Moreover, we may affirm on any independently sufficient ground supported by the record.

BWC's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Denial of Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's challenge to the district court's denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law is, as we have stated, an evidentiary insufficiency argument pressed from various angles. Primarily, BWC contends that, in denying the motion, the court erroneously and prejudicially conceptualized \"confidential\" information more broadly than is permitted under Massachusetts law, which the parties reasonably have agreed governs this diversity action. See, e.g., Merchants Ins. Co. of New Hampshire, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., 143 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1998) (we will give effect to the parties' reasonable agreement as to controlling state law without further choice-of-law analysis). To be specific, BWC argues that the information disclosed at the May 11, 1990 meeting is not covered by the confidentiality agreement because it was neither \"proprietary\" nor a \"trade secret\" and because, as a matter of Massachusetts public policy, confidentiality agreements can protect only trade secrets and proprietary information. Central to this argument is a subsidiary claim that the information disclosed at the meeting was neither a trade secret nor proprietary because it was an obvious solution to an engineering problem derived from information in the public domain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, a review of the Massachusetts cases BWC has cited leaves us in some doubt about whether and how the Massachusetts courts differentiate between confidential information, proprietary information, and trade secrets. Compare Warner-Lambert Co. v. Execuquest Corp., 691 N.E.2d 545, 547 (Mass. 1998) (\"We further have recognized that confidential and proprietary business information may be entitled to protection, even if such information cannot claim trade secret protection.\"), with Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, 385 N.E.2d 1349, 1354 (Mass. 1979) (\"The essence of an action for the wrongful use of trade secrets is the breach of the duty not to disclose or to use without permission confidential information acquired from another.\"). But be that as it may, we do not in this case measure the sufficiency of FMI's evidence against whatever standard Massachusetts law may supply; we measure it against the relevant jury instructions, which were not patently erroneous and thus became the law of the case when BWC failed to object to them. See, e.g., Campos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 97 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that the law of the case doctrine, although not totally rigid, presumptively applies in circumstances such as these); Scott-Harris v. City of Fall River, 134 F.3d 427, 442 &amp; n. 16 (1st Cir.1997) (similar, citing two other civil cases), reversed on other grounds, 523 U.S. 44, 118 S.Ct. 966, 140 L.Ed.2d 79 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury extensively on the issues implicated in BWC's challenge to the denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law. Because these instructions are relevant not only to BWC's primary argument, set forth above, but also to alternative arguments BWC advances in support of its challenge to the court's ruling, described and addressed infra, we quote the instructions at some length:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, this case involves an alleged breach of contract that hinges on a seminal event, the client briefing held at [FMI's] Waltham, Massachusetts, headquarters on May 11, 1990, which was attended by [BWC's] Daniel St. Louis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. St. Louis, as you will recall, was admitted to portions of the briefing only after BWC signed an agreement promising that it would not make any use for five years of confidential information disclosed by [FMI]. That the agreement was a binding contract is not in dispute. What is disputed can be sketched as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[FMI], the plaintiff, alleges that confidential information regarding the construction of its flexible lance hose, specifically, the facts of its Kevlar braid and urethane coating, [and] the name of the supplier, U.S. Composites, were disclosed to Mr. St. Louis at the May 11 meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[BWC], for its part, maintains that nothing of a confidential nature was conveyed to Mr. St. Louis at that meeting. What information was conveyed, [BWC] contends . . . was information that was in the public domain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding this . . . issue, you will want to consider the testimony that was offered about the May 11 meeting and about the information that both preceded the meeting and those [sic] that occurred afterward, as well as the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the entire history of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you find that confidential information was, in fact, disclosed to Mr. St. Louis during the May 11 meeting, you will then move to the second point of contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[FMI] maintains that [BWC] used this information in developing a flexible lance of its own. [BWC] contends that its flexible lance was the brain child of its own engineers and technicians . . . who, [BWC] argues, conceived the lance without the benefit or use of any confidential information provided by [FMI].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In resolving this issue, you will have to look to the testimony that has been offered as to how [BWC's] flexible lance came into being and the testimony that you've heard about the similarities and the differences between the two lances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me turn now to a fuller explanation of the critical aspect of this case, the confidentiality agreement that gave rise to this dispute. You remember that under the terms of the confidentiality agreement, [BWC] promised not to use for five years, at least not without [FMI's] express written approval, any information disclosed by FMI at the May 11, 1990 meeting that was \"confidential, proprietary, or novel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The kinds of information that could be considered confidential, proprietary or novel were, as you will see in the agreement, very broadly defined. The agreement, however, allowed for [an] exception[].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement did not apply to otherwise protected information . . . if [BWC] could . . . [s]how that such information, in its disclosed combinations, was in the public domain through no fault of [BWC].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he parties recognized that information, if in the form it was disclosed, was already public knowledge, even if one or both of the parties was unaware of the fact, [it] could not be deemed confidential even if the agreement defined it as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *[BWC thus could] make use of any information that was already in the public domain or became so through no fault of [BWC].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Public domain\" is a legal term of art, but it refers to information that is generally known to the public at large or the people in a particular trade or business or could be obtained by an interested person with reasonable ease from information publicly available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"confidential,\" as used in the agreement, means information of a private nature that is entrusted to a third party with the expectation that it will be kept secret. \"Novel\" means something different from anything ever seen or known before. \"Proprietary\" refers to some protectable ownership interest in information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, the term \"confidential\" has a broader meaning in the [sic] than the terms \"novel\" and \"proprietary,\" and it is the term that the parties have focused upon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test of whether information is, in fact, confidential has both an objective and subjective component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test is objective in the sense that the information must be of the kind that a reasonable person would recognize as exclusive or private and likely to be known or appreciated only by its possession, even if it does not amount to a \"secret\" in the popular sense of the word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Information that is, on the other hand, readily known or knowable to the interest of the public cannot, as I have said, be made confidential simply by slapping it with a restrictive label.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test is subjective in the sense that the party imparting the information must manifest an expectation that it will be kept private by the person to whom it is conveyed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One obvious measure of whether a party truly regards information as confidential is the extent to which it takes diligent precautions to safeguard the information from inadvertent dissemination or improper use by others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this point, it be apparent that [FMI] has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that, one, confidential information was disclosed to [BWC] at the May 11, 1990 meeting and, that, two, [BWC] made use of that information in developing its flexible lance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have suggested, BWC ignores these instructions and, citing to Massachusetts trade secrets law, contends that FMI's hose was not subject to protection under the agreement because it was an obvious solution to the engineering problem posed by the Canadian project. In so arguing, BWC highlights the following uncontested evidence: (1) the idea of combining Kevlar and urethane (used as an adhesive but not a coating) was disclosed in two pre-1988 hose patents, and the same combination was advertised by another hose company in 1989; (2) FMI engineer Boyce acknowledged on cross-examination that \"the simple idea of combining polyurethane as a matrix with Kevlar fibers\" was not a secret; and (3) BWC's liability expert - the only formally designated liability expert to testify in the case - asserted that the FMI hose was based on well-known engineering principles and materials in common use, and could easily have been designed by \"an engineer using principles available in 1990 and using well-established technology.\" BWC also points to the fact that Leary provided St. Louis with the address of U.S. Composites after the May 11, 1990 meeting, asking why FMI would so freely share this information if it were truly a trade secret.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a properly instructed jury had found that BWC had misappropriated an FMI trade secret under Massachusetts law, a sufficiency challenge to the verdict might well present a close question. But here, the jury was not asked to make such a finding. Instead, after being told without objection that \"confidential\" information has \"a broader meaning\" than \"novel\" or \"proprietary\" information, the jury merely was asked to decide whether (1) there had been a disclosure of information that a \"reasonable person would recognize as exclusive or private and likely to be known or appreciated only by its possession, even if it does not amount to a 'secret' in the popular sense of the word\"; (2) FMI had \"manifest[ed] an expectation that [such information would] be kept private by [BWC]\"; and (3) the information, \"in its disclosed combinations,\" was, through no fault of BWC, \"known to the public at large or the people in [the relevant] trade or business or could be obtained by an interested person with reasonable ease from information publicly available.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first question, the jury reasonably could have found that, prior to May 11, 1990, there was no generally available hose small, strong, and flexible enough for the Canadian application. The jury also reasonably could have found that, during the May 11, 1990 meeting, FMI disclosed to BWC that it had developed such a hose; that the hose was constructed from a unique \"recipe\" involving a nylon core, a double-braided sheath of Kevlar, and a polyurethane coating; and that U.S. Composites had successfully manufactured the hose. Finally, the jury reasonably could have found that the hose was the culmination of nearly two years of research and development, and that the hose would give FMI a significant leg up in bidding on Ontario Hydro's sludge removal business, which the utility clearly regarded as an urgent and time-sensitive problem. If indeed the jury made these permissible findings, it was entitled to conclude that a reasonable person would regard FMI's hose technology as both likely to be appreciated only by its possession and something FMI would have wanted to keep from its only competitor for the sludge removal contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the second question, the very fact that FMI compelled BWC and U.S. Composites to sign confidentiality agreements prior to making any disclosures allowed the jury to conclude that FMI had manifested a subjective expectation that the hose technology would be kept confidential. In so ruling, we acknowledge that Leary's openness with St. Louis at and after the May 11, 1990 meeting seems to undermine FMI's claim that it regarded as confidential the information disclosed in the Leary/St. Louis conversations. But in the end, we think that the jury reasonably could have regarded Leary's disclosures as unusual revelations of protected information during an unusual period of cooperation between competitors, made more freely because of Leary's knowledge of the signed confidentiality agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, with respect to the third question, we believe that the jury reasonably could have found that the information Leary related to St. Louis at the May 11, 1990 meeting was neither known within the hose industry \"in its disclosed combinations\" nor obtainable from public information with reasonable ease. In making its public domain argument, BWC understandably focuses on the fact that, generally speaking, there was at the relevant point in time nothing secret about constructing a hose with a nylon core, a Kevlar braid, and polyurethane. But nothing in the instructions required the jury to decide the public domain issue at this level of generality. Rather, we think that, as instructed, the jury was entitled ask itself a much more specific question: On May 11, 1990, could an interested party have learned with reasonable ease from publicly available information that there existed a polyurethane-coated, Kevlar-reinforced nylon hose that was small, strong, and flexible enough to remove sludge within even the tiny gaps between the tube bundles in Canadian nuclear reactors? The evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the jury's negative response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of BWC's primary argument, we turn to its alternative challenges to the district court's denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law. BWC's first alternative argument is that, even if FMI disclosed confidential information on May 11, 1990, BWC never \"used\" the information in violation of the agreement because BWC engineers did not \"incorporate\" the information into the BWC hose. (BWC Brief at 35.) We recognize that, in addressing BWC's motion, the trial judge accepted that incorporation was the standard by which the jury should have gauged whether there had been an unlawful use. See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, No. 93-12465-RGS, at 6-7 (D. Mass. December 31, 1998) (memorandum of decision and order on defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law). The court reached this conclusion because, in its opinion, FMI had argued exclusively at trial that there had been such an incorporation. See id. But even if we shared the lower court's view of the trial record, we would disagree with its conclusion. Theories presented in opening and closing arguments do not necessarily curb a jury's discretion in this way. As we already have stated, a jury verdict will stand so long as the evidence makes it reasonable under \"any permissible claim or theory.\" Collazo-Santiago, 149 F.3d at 27 (emphasis supplied). Here, the jury was not asked to find incorporation; it more broadly was asked, without objection from BWC, whether BWC \"used\" the information in violation of the agreement. BWC cannot now complain that the jury may have understood the term \"use\" in its ordinary sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So viewed, the use issue is not close. There was abundant evidence that BWC developed its hose far more quickly than otherwise would have been possible because it started with and proceeded from the knowledge that a viable hose could be constructed from nylon, Kevlar, and polyurethane. Moreover, there was evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found that BWC \"used\" the May 11, 1990 disclosure of U.S. Composites as the hose manufacturer to obtain an FMI hose sample from U.S. Composites, test the sample, and apply the test results in developing its own hose. Thus, the evidence adequately supported the jury's conclusion that BWC wrongfully used the confidential information disclosed on May 11, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pointing to evidence that Ontario Hydro in fact owned the hose technology at issue in this case, BWC next contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion that the technology was proprietary to FMI under Massachusetts law. In BWC's view, one cannot protect under a confidentiality agreement that which one does not own. BWC did not, however, present this argument to the lower court when it moved for judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we deem the argument waived. See, e.g., Hammond v. T.J. Litle &amp; Co., Inc., 82 F.3d 1166, 1171 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, BWC argues that it should prevail because FMI did not formally designate an expert to testify as to liability issues. More particularly, BWC takes the position that expert testimony was required for the jury rationally to have answered whether (1) the \"combination of materials [in the FMI hose was] an idea so unique that an engineer with the appropriate training and experience could . . . readily discover it\"; and (2) \"BWC had incorporated aspects of the FMI hose that were proprietary to FMI.\" (BWC Brief at 47-48 (emphasis in original)). But as we have explained, these questions - which again are based on the premise that the jury was instructed in strict accordance with Massachusetts trade secrets law (or at least BWC's view of such law) - were not questions that the instructions required the jury to answer. Based on our review of the record as a whole, we are satisfied that competent evidence supports the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Admission in Evidence of Lichtman Notes and Failure to Give Curative Instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC asserts that the district court erred in admitting the Lichtman notes in evidence, and then exacerbated its error by failing to give a curative instruction after FMI, in arguing to the jury during its closing that its hose was not an obvious extension of existing technology, used the Lichtman notes in a manner prohibited by the hearsay rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 802 (prohibiting the introduction of hearsay evidence). In BWC's view, the court's failure to give a curative instruction effectively permitted FMI to use inadmissible double hearsay as substantive expert testimony on a crucial liability issue. FMI responds that the Lichtman notes were admitted for two permissible non-hearsay purposes - (1) to show what information Babbitt and Leary had when they conducted their hose searches; and (2) to show the falsity of the vendors' impressions, see United States v. Adkins, 741 F.2d 744, 746 (5th Cir. 1984) (\"When statements are introduced to prove the falsity of the matter asserted, they are not inadmissible as hearsay.\") - and, in any event, were properly admitted as a business record. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) (setting forth the \"[r]ecords of regularly conducted business activity\" hearsay exception).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FMI successfully moved the Lichtman notes in evidence during its direct examination of Chip Babbitt. After overruling BWC's objection to admission of the notes, and in response to BWC's subsequent request for a limiting instruction, the district court addressed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jurors, if I can anticipate what [BWC's counsel] is asking me to tell you with respect to this last exhibit, the man - that is, Mr. Lichtman - who prepared these notes upon which this witness relied, because of medical problems, is unavailable to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He had a cerebral hemorrhage so he cannot come into court and testify about the circumstances under which he prepared these notes which contain a fair amount of hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He is in the business of calling on people and asking them certain questions about the availability of this product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm sure what [BWC's counsel] wants me to do is to point this out to you, that while this witness [Chip Babbitt] may have relied on these notes, we are in a position today, even though I've admitted them as evidence, of not being able to go back to their author to really explore the manner in which these notes were assembled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked if this was what BWC's counsel had in mind in requesting the limiting instruction, counsel informed the court: \"It is exactly, your Honor.\" FMI then went on to question Babbitt about the particulars of his hose search, asking whether and why Babbitt did or did not contact vendors with whom Lichtman previously had spoken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The context in which the notes were admitted, the court's admonition that the notes contain \"a fair amount of hearsay,\" and the court's two explicit references to Babbitt relying on the notes, combine to suggest that the court did not admit the Lichtman notes as evidence tending to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein. Instead, these factors make it far more likely that the notes were admitted for the limited purpose of helping to establish the factual context in which Babbitt began his hose search. Admission of the notes for this limited purpose would not have violated the hearsay rule and therefore would have been within the court's discretion. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) (defining hearsay as a \"statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial, or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\"). Moreover, even if the court admitted the notes for a different purpose, the fact that the notes were admissible for the purpose just described is sufficient to support their consideration by a properly instructed jury. See LaBarre v. Shepard, 84 F.3d 496, 500-01 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[W]e can affirm the admission of evidence on any proper basis, even if the trial judge relied on a different ground.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, whether the notes conceivably could have come into evidence for a proper purpose is a different question from whether the court permitted FMI to use them improperly. And it is on this latter issue that BWC primarily focuses its appellate argument. In particular, BWC complains about the following passage from FMI's closing argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What [FMI] did in 1988 was they called the leading hose companies in the world and said, This is our problem, do you have an answer, which is the way it works in real life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And what we found out was two things: First of all, the top guy in the world, Rogan, from Rogan &amp; Shanley, other vendors refer to Rogan &amp; Shanley as the prime source for small-diameter high-pressure hose, spoke to Lichtman twice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He said there are technical problems which Rogan feels may be insuperable at almost any price. In short, Rogan thinks we're wasting our time. People told Columbus he shouldn't have sailed to America.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC contends that this portion of FMI's closing argument effectively converted Rogan's out-of-court statement (as related by the non-testifying Lichtman) into substantive expert testimony that the hose FMI developed was not an obvious extension of extant, publicly known hose technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's contention fails to take account, however, of the unusual procedural posture in which this issue comes before us. BWC did not object to this argument when it was made. It instead brought the issue up at the sidebar conference following the court's jury instructions, when it asked the district court to repeat its earlier limiting instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[BWC's Counsel]: Your honor, [FMI's counsel] again emphasized the importance of the Lichtman notes in his closing, and we would ask for another cautionary instruction on the hearsay nature of this document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: If he did emphasize it, it [e]luded me completely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[BWC's Counsel]: Your Honor, what [FMI's counsel] did was to take the hearsay portions of those notes, Mr. Rogan, what Mr. Rogan said about this being an impossible task, and used those as expert testimony where, in fact, Mr. Rogan was not before the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[BWC's Counsel]: We understood those were only admitted to show this was the beginning of a hose search and Mr. Rogan - anything of a hearsay nature about what Mr. Rogan believed about the difficulty would not come in as expert testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Well, I just want to call attention to specific - I'm just going to have to trust that the jury will understand that they have to follow my instructions limiting, excluding, and disregarding evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the question is not whether the court should have instructed the jury to disregard FMI's counsel's argument; it is only whether, in light of unobjected-to interceding events, the court should have repeated its earlier instruction to the effect that the Lichtman notes should only be considered for limited, non-hearsay purposes. The court did not abuse its discretion in declining to repeat what it already had said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Remaining Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's remaining arguments do not require extended discussion. BWC first complains that the district court committed reversible error in instructing the jury on the weighing of \"differ[ing]\" expert testimony because FMI presented no expert testimony as to liability. In rejecting BWC's challenge to its instruction, the court stated that it had given the instruction to guide the jury with respect to the differing testimony given by each side's damages expert. The court did not abuse its discretion in so reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC next asserts that the district court erred in failing to evaluate BWC's motion to exclude FMI's damages expert under the reliability standard set forth in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), and refined in Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. 137. BWC also contends that, had the court performed a Daubert analysis, it would have excluded the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that the district court failed to assess whether FMI's damages expert's testimony \"both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand,\" Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597, BWC wrests out of context the court's statement that the proposed testimony \"raises no issues . . . that . . . implicate[] the rule of Daubert.\" The statement BWC relies upon is more fairly evaluated in full context:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the testimony of [each side's damages expert], I've had the opportunity last night to review the reports and exhibits that I was provided . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[FMI's damages expert's] report, to my mind, raises no issues of unconventional hypothesis or unorthodox methodology that, in my mind, implicates the rule of Daubert v. Dow Pharmaceuticals . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't find that these differences [between each side's experts' proposed testimony], again, raise any of the kind of concerns that Daubert addresses, nor do I find anything about the credentials of either economist that would cause me to doubt that they are unqualified to give testimony of this kind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the conflict[s] between the two views [are] the ordinary sorts of differences that I encounter all the time between economists over issues like this which, to some degree, are speculative and have to be speculative because you're talking about events that did not occur, about a future that hasn't been revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I think that I'm not going to allow the motion to hold . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is a fundamental difficulty that emerges with either expert's testimony, I'll handle that in a more conventional method by simply striking or telling the jury to disregard that aspect of the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this passage makes clear that the district court evaluated the proposed testimony for reliability and concluded that it was sufficiently reliable for admission in evidence. We thus reject BWC's claim that the court did not evaluate the testimony under Daubert. And having rejected the argument that the court improperly failed to perform its gatekeeping function under Daubert, we also reject as based on a faulty factual premise the argument that the court would have excluded plaintiff's damages expert's testimony had it applied Daubert. In reaching this latter conclusion, we think it significant that BWC has not here challenged the damages verdict as based upon speculative or insufficiently reliable evidence introduced at trial. Indeed, in connection with this issue, BWC's brief makes no mention at all of the testimony FMI's damages expert gave at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's final argument is that the district court abused its discretion in ordering that (1) certain documents produced by FMI during discovery \"be used only for purposes related to the instant litigation\"; and (2) \"any notations made [by FMI] on the documents after their creation be deleted.\" The documents in question were all initially marked confidential by FMI and produced under an agreed-to protective order which limited the parties' ability to use materials so marked. BWC alleges that the documents demonstrate \"that FMI had, on numerous occasions, gained unauthorized access to information about BWC's sludge lance designs and financial information, in some instances by taking it from desks of Ontario Hydro employees or directly off Ontario Hydro's facsimile machines.\" (BWC Brief at 20.) BWC does not suggest that the court's order hampered its trial preparation. Rather, BWC appears interested in using the materials for purposes unrelated to this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever merit there might be to BWC's claimed entitlement to use as it sees fit the documents, complete with FMI's notations thereon, the fact is that BWC never argued such an entitlement to the district court. These documents only were brought to the lower court's attention by means of BWC's \"Motion to Remove Confidential Designations from Certain Documents Produced by Plaintiffs,\" which the court granted subject to the restrictions noted above. In that motion, BWC asserted only that the inaccurate confidential designations were hampering its trial preparation efforts; it in no way argued an entitlement to use the materials for non-litigation related purposes. Moreover, BWC never asked the court to reconsider the restrictions, which were imposed in response to FMI submissions expressing concern that BWC intended to use the materials for such purposes (which submissions BWC did not oppose on grounds of entitlement to use the material for such purposes). Under the circumstances, we regard the argument BWC presses here as waived. See, e.g., National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 749 (1st Cir. 1995) (arguments not presented below are waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. FMI's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Denial of Motion for New Trial on Damages</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1994, FMI established a wholly owned subsidiary named Foster-Miller Canada (FMC) to compete for water lancing contracts in Canada. During discovery, FMI acknowledged that FMC, and not FMI, would have bid on any post-March 1994 contracts wrongfully won by BWC as a result of its breach of the confidentiality agreement. FMI's damages expert, without explaining why, included FMC's projected lost profits in arriving at the FMI damages calculations set forth in his report. Prior to trial, BWC moved in limine to preclude FMI from presenting evidence of FMC's lost profits, arguing that FMI alone was the plaintiff and that FMI was not entitled to profits that would have gone to its wholly owned subsidiary. In opposition, FMI simply asserted that \"the law thoroughly and indisputably establishes that a parent/stockholder ([FMI]) can recover damages to a subsidiary/corporation ([FMC]) flowing from breach of an agreement with the parent/stockholder (BWC's agreement with [FMI]) . . . .\" The district court agreed with BWC and barred FMI from presenting testimony regarding FMC's lost profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the verdict, FMI moved for a partial new trial on damages, arguing for the first time that it had been entitled to FMC's lost profits because such profits accurately measured the diminution in the value of FMC caused by BWC's conduct: \"FMI was a 100% shareholder of [FMC, and] profits lost by [FMC] translated, dollar for dollar, into a loss to [FMI] because of the loss in the value of its ownership interest in [FMC].\" (FMI's Motion for Partial New Trial at 4.) In other words, rather than simply asserting an entitlement to its wholly owned subsidiary's lost profits (as it had done prior to trial), FMI now was asserting both an entitlement to the diminution in value of its wholly owned asset, and that the asset's lost profits accurately measured such diminution. In a margin order, the district court rejected this theory as, inter alia, \"raised too late in the game.\" (Id. at 1.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, FMI renews its claimed entitlement to recover the diminished value of BWC. In so arguing, FMI once again asserts that BWC's lost profits are the proper measure of such diminution. But even if we assume arguendo that FMI was entitled to recover FMC's diminished value as part of its damages, we think that the \"FMC's lost profits = FMC's diminished value\" premise of FMI's argument is sufficiently debatable to have required its disclosure to BWC during discovery. Clearly, lost profits and diminished corporate value are distinct concepts, see, e.g., Protectors Ins. Service, Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 132 F.3d 612, 617-18 (10th Cir. 1998), and we are not prepared to say that the measure of diminished corporate value will always meet or exceed the measure of the corporation's lost profits. Had FMI afforded BWC notice that it was seeking FMC's lost profits as a measure of FMC's diminished value, BWC would have been afforded the opportunity to develop a competing valuation theory. The district court's decision to reject FMI's theory as untimely was thus within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Discovery Sanction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During discovery, BWC served upon FMI a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deposition notice covering fourteen topics. FMI did not produce witnesses competent to testify as to five of the topics because BWC had in the early stages of the case already deposed the employees FMI regarded as most knowledgeable on those topics. Instead, with respect to these five topics, FMI's counsel wrote BWC's counsel and asked him to specify whether he wanted FMI (1) to recall these witnesses; (2) to produce additional witnesses; or (3) to designate the prior deposition testimony as Rule 30(b)(6) testimony. BWC subsequently moved for an order compelling FMI to comply with its Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice, which the district court granted. The court also awarded BWC the costs and fees it incurred in bringing the motion to compel. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d) (requiring an award of costs and fees upon the granting of such a motion \"unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, FMI argues that its conduct was reasonable under the circumstances and that the district court's sanction was an abuse of its discretion. But our review of the record reveals that the court had reason to conclude that FMI, by asking BWC whom it wished to testify on behalf of FMI for Rule 30(b)(6) purposes (or what testimony it wished FMI to designate as Rule 30(b)(6) testimony), effectively attempted to shift to BWC the onus of identifying who best spoke for FMI on the matters in question. Such a burden shift is contrary to the purposes of Rule 30(b)(6). See Mistui &amp; Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. v. Puerto Rico Water Resources Auth., 93 F.R.D. 62, 66-67 (D.P.R. 1981). In any event, FMI cannot and does not deny that, strictly speaking, it failed either to designate witnesses competent to address each of the topics specified in the Rule 30(b)(6) notice or to obtain from the court an appropriate protective order. The court thus did not abuse its discretion in strictly enforcing Rule 30(b)(6). See id. Nor did the court abuse its discretion in concluding that FMI's failure to comply with the notice was not \"substantially justified\" within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the orders and judgments appealed from in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

BWC appeals from an interlocutory order denying one of its discovery motions, the judgment entered pursuant to the jury's verdict, and the judgment entered pursuant to a memorandum and order denying its post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law. BWC's principal claim is one of evidentiary insufficiency. FMI cross-appeals from orders sanctioning it for a discovery abuse and denying its motion for a partial new trial on damages.

We therefore eschew a comprehensive recitation of the litigation and confine our present focus to matters relevant to these appeals. In doing so, we sometimes defer more detailed descriptions of pertinent events to our discussions of the specific arguments advanced. And as in any case that challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we present the historical facts as the jury might have found them, consistent with the record but in a light most favorable to the verdict. See, e.g., Grajales-Romero v. American Airlines Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198693\"><a href=\"/opinion/198693/grajales-romero-v-american-airlines/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1980s, both FMI and BWC became involved in the business of cleaning nuclear powered steam generators. Impurities in the water boiled off in a nuclear generator leave on the generator's bundled tubes an often extremely hard sediment called \"sludge.\" Over time, sludge deposits corrode and wear away the tubes. Sludge-generated corrosion is a major problem in nuclear generators. If unchecked, it can lead to radioactive leaks and astronomically expensive plant shutdowns needed to effectuate repairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1980s, FMI and BWC were the only two companies engaged in the business of \"sludge lancing.\" Sludge lancing flushes away accumulated sludge on a generator's tubes with a thin stream of pressurized water delivered through a high pressure hose encased within a metal water lance. By the late 1980s, BWC had developed a manual sludge lancing system for cleaning the nuclear generators of Ontario Hydro, a Canadian public utility. The relationship between BWC and Ontario Hydro was longstanding; BWC had designed Ontario Hydro's generators. But because the water lance and stainless steel reinforced hose in BWC's system were insufficiently flexible to maneuver into more than half of the many nooks and crannies between and among the tube bundles in Ontario Hydro's generators, the tubes - which are significantly closer together in Canadian generators than in the typical United States commercial generator - were caked with a disconcerting amount of unreachable sludge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, by the late 1980s, FMI had developed a robotically controlled \"flexlance\" sludge removal system. As initially designed, FMI's lance contained a stainless steel braided hose flexible enough to bend 90 degrees. This flexibility permitted the lance to enter the relatively wide gaps between and among the tubes in United States commercial generators for purposes of sludge removal. In 1988, FMI began research into adapting its flexlance system for use on the steam generators used in United States Navy nuclear powered vessels. The adaptation process was not straightforward because, like the Canadian generators, the naval generators had significantly smaller inter-tube gaps than United States commercial generators, and the lance and hose developed for use in the commercial generators would not fit into these narrower spaces. Thus, in August 1988, FMI began research into one of the central problems of the adaption process and the problem at the heart of this lawsuit: acquiring or developing a hose small enough (.125 inch outer diameter) to maneuver into the tube gaps in the naval generators, strong enough to withstand the very high burst pressures (10,000 pounds per square inch) needed for effective sludge removal, and yet flexible enough to bend up to 90 degrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, FMI retained an outside consultant, Philip Lichtman, to look into whether such a hose might be available from a commercial hose vendor. Lichtman did not testify at trial, but notes he made in connection with his hose search (which were admitted into evidence over BWC's objection) suggested that his search was unsuccessful. The following is an excerpt from the so-called Lichtman notes that is particularly important to this appeal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Time after time, other vendors refer to Rogan &amp; Shanley as the prime source for small-diameter high pressure hose. I spoke with Dr. Rogan twice . . . . [T]here are technical problems which Rogan feels may be virtually insuperable at almost any price. In short, Rogan thinks [FMI] is wasting [its] time; that only [insufficiently flexible] metal tube will do the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other sections, the Lichtman notes indicate that a second vendor also had described the project as \"insuperable,\" and that a third vendor had thought developing such a small, strong, and flexible hose would be \"very difficult.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1988, an FMI engineer named Chip Babbitt conducted a second commercial hose search. Babbitt used Lichtman's notes as a starting point and followed up with several of the vendors Lichtman previously had contacted. Like Lichtman, Babbitt had no luck finding a commercial hose suitable for the naval application. He then mentioned his problem to another FMI engineer, Jay Boyce. Boyce suggested that a hose with a Kevlar braid reinforcement be used. Kevlar is a strong and flexible fiber, but it is highly susceptible to fraying. Boyce also suggested that Babbitt discuss his problem with Glenn Freitas, an FMI engineer who had experience with fiber braiding. Freitas concurred in Boyce's Kevlar suggestion and further recommended that the braided Kevlar be coated with an elastomeric matrix (i.e., a flexible coating typically made from rubber or plastic) to protect the Kevlar from abrasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Babbitt began to look for a company that could manufacture a hose of the size and strength needed for the Navy project. In the fall of 1988, Babbitt wrote to a number of hose manufacturers. In his letters, he set forth the size, flexibility, and pressure requirements of the contemplated hose. Although the letters explicitly mentioned the possibility of using stainless steel to reinforce the hose (the approach advocated by many of the manufacturers Babbitt had contacted during his hose search), the letters also suggested that the hose might be constructed with a flexible nylon core, reinforced with a Kevlar overbraid, and coated with a flexible elastomeric matrix \"such as a urethane.\" One of the companies Babbitt contacted at this time was U.S. Composites, a braiding company that had not previously been involved in designing or manufacturing hoses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1988, FMI commissioned U.S. Composites and another manufacturer to create some Kevlar hose samples in the event a suitable stainless steel reinforced hose could not be designed. In January 1989, U.S. Composites shipped FMI a set of uncoated Kevlar-braided hose samples, which FMI found to be \"among the most promising\" of the hose prototypes then available. In February 1989, Daniel Fischbach, another FMI engineer, replaced Babbitt on the hose development project. The following month, although FMI was still experimenting with a stainless steel reinforced hose, FMI and U.S. Composites entered into a contract under which U.S. Composites would continue to manufacture and supply to FMI hose samples with Kevlar overbraids. This contract, along with two other FMI/U.S. Composites contracts covering the emerging naval hose technology, contained a confidentiality agreement designed to protect the emerging technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring and summer of 1989, FMI tested a number of Kevlar-wrapped hose samples and experienced problems with bursting. Throughout this time, FMI was still contemplating whether to protect the Kevlar by coating it with a matrix such as urethane or by surrounding it with a separate outside cover. By fall, FMI was leaning towards a coated, coverless hose and had U.S. Composites experimentally coat its samples with various types of urethanes and epoxies. By December 1989, U.S. Composites had generated samples of hose using a number of different coating materials. Eventually, FMI chose for the Navy project a hose with a nylon core, a single layer of Kevlar braid, and a urethane coating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, back in 1988, after FMI had begun work on the naval project, Ontario Hydro approached FMI about the possibility of applying its flexlance technology to clean the tube bundles within its generators. Shortly thereafter, William Schneider of BWC called FMI and proposed that the two competitors cooperate, as each of the companies had information and technology that might prove useful in solving Ontario Hydro's sludge problem. Eventually, the companies submitted to Ontario Hydro separate proposals for jointly studying and addressing the problem. The companies did not share their proposals with each other, as each proposal contained confidential information. FMI subsequently entered into a separate agreement with Ontario Hydro to study the feasibility of using the flexlance system in Canadian generators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1990, FMI assigned William Leary, an engineer who had assisted in the completion of the Navy project, the task of obtaining a flexible hose for a lance to be used in the Canadian generators. The hose could be slightly larger (.200 inch outer diameter) than the Navy hose, but it required a greater pressure retention capacity. Like Lichtman and Babbitt, Leary first attempted to find a suitable commercial hose. Using Lichtman's and Babbitt's search notes as his starting point, Leary contacted twenty-five different manufacturers. His search was unsuccessful. Leary thus turned to the naval project engineers and asked how the Navy hose might be adapted to the Canadian application. The engineers agreed that wrapping a second layer of Kevlar around the hose might do the trick. Subsequently, FMI contacted U.S. Composites and asked it to create a hose similar to the Navy hose but with a double wrap of Kevlar. In early April 1990, U.S. Composites shipped samples of the requested hose to FMI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leary's hose work proceeded as FMI was preparing its feasibility study for Ontario Hydro. On May 11, 1990, an Ontario Hydro representative agreed to travel to FMI's research and development facility in Waltham, Massachusetts, for a meeting to discuss the progress of the study. Ontario Hydro requested that a BWC engineer, Daniel St. Louis, also attend the meeting. St. Louis understood that he had been invited to provide input with respect to certain water lancing tests necessary to completion of the study. FMI agreed to St. Louis' presence but required BWC to execute a confidentiality agreement to protect confidential information that would be discussed at the meeting. In relevant part, the agreement provided that, for a period of five years, BWC would not \"use FMI's [confidential, proprietary or novel information] for any purpose unless specifically authorized in writing by FMI.\" The agreement also explicitly excluded from the definition of \"confidential, proprietary or novel information\" that which, \"in its disclosed combination[s], is in the public domain through no fault of [BWC].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meeting lasted the better part of the day, and St. Louis was excluded from a number of discussions involving sensitive FMI technology and information. But in a brief presentation towards the end of the meeting, Leary showed St. Louis a sample of the hose FMI was developing for the Canadian application. Leary told St. Louis that the hose had a nylon core, Kevlar-wrap, and urethane coating. Leary also informed St. Louis that U.S. Composites was manufacturing the hose for FMI. Unbeknownst to Leary and FMI, St. Louis was at the time spearheading an effort by BWC to develop a 90-degree flexible lance of its own. At some point after the meeting, St. Louis called Leary and obtained from him the address of U.S. Composites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, St. Louis contacted U.S. Composites and spoke with its president, Hugo Kruesi. St. Louis asked Kruesi if U.S. Composites could make for BWC \"a similar hose to that . . . provided for [FMI].\" In the course of several subsequent telephone conversations between Kruesi and St. Louis, Kruesi provided St. Louis with two price quotations and detailed information regarding the FMI hose's construction. St. Louis also obtained from U.S. Composites a sample of FMI's hose, which he subjected to analysis and testing. By the fall of 1990, however, Kruesi had become concerned that his interactions with BWC were violative of the confidentiality agreements between FMI and U.S. Composites. He thus telephoned FMI and asked whether there would be a problem if U.S. Composites were to produce a high pressure flexible hose for BWC. FMI asked Kruesi to hold off on manufacturing anything for BWC. Subsequently, BWC asked FMI for permission to develop a high pressure flexible hose through U.S. Composites, but FMI declined to grant such permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990, two months prior to the May 11 meeting at FMI, BWC had still been proposing sludge removal with the relatively inflexible stainless steel technology it had been using for years. It was not until April 1990, when Ontario Hydro suggested to it the need for a more flexible lance, that BWC even began to contemplate designing its own product capable of bending up to 90 degrees. And it was not until after the May 11 meeting, during the period of time that St. Louis initiated contacts with U.S. Composites, that BWC documented any research into the development of a such a product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 1990, BWC made its first proposal to Ontario Hydro to develop a water lance of sufficient size and strength to meet Ontario Hydro's sludge lancing needs yet capable of bending up to 90 degrees. The proposal specifically disclaimed any guarantee of success \"in view of the developmental nature of the work.\" At some point in the months that followed, BWC performed its own unsuccessful search for a commercial hose suitable for use in Canadian generators. During this same period of time, St. Louis also subjected the FMI hose sample to destructive testing. The FMI hose was the only sample St. Louis ever tested. By November 1990, BWC's flexible lance was complete \"except for the tubing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, at some point after its efforts to work with U.S. Composites had fallen through, BWC contracted with a Canadian company known as Barrday to manufacture its hose. As initially designed, the BWC hose, like the FMI hose, had a nylon core reinforced with a sheathing of urethane-coated and braided Kevlar. But it was different in many respects. Unlike the FMI hose, the BWC hose was not \"wet braided\"; it instead was pulled through a bucket of urethane (of a different type than that used by FMI) after the Kevlar had already been braided upon the hose. Moreover, the BWC hose had an outer abrasion cover. Finally, the BWC hose used thicker strands of Kevlar weaved onto the core tube at a somewhat different angle than that employed by FMI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the life of the FMI/BWC confidentiality agreement, Ontario Hydro sought bids on sixteen jobs requiring the contractor to perform sludge removal with a water lance flexible enough to bend 90 degrees. FMI successfully bid on one of these jobs; BWC won the other fifteen. At trial, FMI took the position that, but for BWC's wrongful use of confidential information regarding the FMI hose disclosed at the May 11, 1990 meeting, FMI would have won all sixteen contracts. FMI's theory was that BWC copied and then built upon FMI's basic hose design, the basic elements of which (along with the name of the hose's manufacturer) BWC ascertained from Leary's presentation at the meeting. FMI argued to the jury that this breach of the confidentiality agreement permitted BWC to enter the relevant market quickly enough to secure contracts that otherwise would have gone to FMI. The jury agreed and, as we have stated, set FMI's damages at just over five million dollars. These cross-appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's principal argument, made from various vantages, is that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law based on evidentiary insufficiency. BWC also contends that the court erred in admitting the Lichtman notes in evidence and then compounded its error by failing to give a curative instruction after the notes were misused by FMI during its closing argument. Finally, BWC asserts that the court committed reversible error in instructing the jury on the weighing of expert testimony, in denying its motion in limine seeking to limit or exclude the testimony of FMI's damages expert, and in making certain FMI documents obtained by BWC during discovery the subject of a protective order. For its part, FMI argues that the court erred in declining to award it a new trial on damages after erroneously precluding it from introducing lost profits evidence relating to a Canadian subsidiary FMI established in 1994, and in sanctioning it for failing to comply with a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deposition notice served during discovery by BWC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

BWC's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Denial of Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's challenge to the district court's denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law is, as we have stated, an evidentiary insufficiency argument pressed from various angles. Primarily, BWC contends that, in denying the motion, the court erroneously and prejudicially conceptualized \"confidential\" information more broadly than is permitted under Massachusetts law, which the parties reasonably have agreed governs this diversity action. See, e.g., Merchants Ins. Co. of New Hampshire, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197929\"><a href=\"/opinion/197929/merchants-insurance-v-guaranty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1998) (we will give effect to the parties' reasonable agreement as to controlling state law without further choice-of-law analysis). To be specific, BWC argues that the information disclosed at the May 11, 1990 meeting is not covered by the confidentiality agreement because it was neither \"proprietary\" nor a \"trade secret\" and because, as a matter of Massachusetts public policy, confidentiality agreements can protect only trade secrets and proprietary information. Central to this argument is a subsidiary claim that the information disclosed at the meeting was neither a trade secret nor proprietary because it was an obvious solution to an engineering problem derived from information in the public domain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, a review of the Massachusetts cases BWC has cited leaves us in some doubt about whether and how the Massachusetts courts differentiate between confidential information, proprietary information, and trade secrets. Compare Warner-Lambert Co. v. Execuquest Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></span>, 547 (Mass. 1998) (\"We further have recognized that confidential and proprietary business information may be entitled to protection, even if such information cannot claim trade secret protection.\"), with Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></span>, 1354 (Mass. 1979) (\"The essence of an action for the wrongful use of trade secrets is the breach of the duty not to disclose or to use without permission confidential information acquired from another.\"). But be that as it may, we do not in this case measure the sufficiency of FMI's evidence against whatever standard Massachusetts law may supply; we measure it against the relevant jury instructions, which were not patently erroneous and thus became the law of the case when BWC failed to object to them. See, e.g., Campos-Orrego v.

You remember that under the terms of the confidentiality agreement, [BWC] promised not to use for five years, at least not without [FMI's] express written approval, any information disclosed by FMI at the May 11, 1990 meeting that was \"confidential, proprietary, or novel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The kinds of information that could be considered confidential, proprietary or novel were, as you will see in the agreement, very broadly defined.

In so arguing, BWC highlights the following uncontested evidence: (1) the idea of combining Kevlar and urethane (used as an adhesive but not a coating) was disclosed in two pre-1988 hose patents, and the same combination was advertised by another hose company in 1989; (2) FMI engineer Boyce acknowledged on cross-examination that \"the simple idea of combining polyurethane as a matrix with Kevlar fibers\" was not a secret; and (3) BWC's liability expert - the only formally designated liability expert to testify in the case - asserted that the FMI hose was based on well-known engineering principles and materials in common use, and could easily have been designed by \"an engineer using principles available in 1990 and using well-established technology.\" BWC also points to the fact that Leary provided St. Louis with the address of U.S. Composites after the May 11, 1990 meeting, asking why FMI would so freely share this information if it were truly a trade secret.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a properly instructed jury had found that BWC had misappropriated an FMI trade secret under Massachusetts law, a sufficiency challenge to the verdict might well present a close question. But here, the jury was not asked to make such a finding. Instead, after being told without objection that \"confidential\" information has \"a broader meaning\" than \"novel\" or \"proprietary\" information, the jury merely was asked to decide whether (1) there had been a disclosure of information that a \"reasonable person would recognize as exclusive or private and likely to be known or appreciated only by its possession, even if it does not amount to a 'secret' in the popular sense of the word\"; (2) FMI had \"manifest[ed] an expectation that [such information would] be kept private by [BWC]\"; and (3) the information, \"in its disclosed combinations,\" was, through no fault of BWC, \"known to the public at large or the people in [the relevant] trade or business or could be obtained by an interested person with reasonable ease from information publicly available.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first question, the jury reasonably could have found that, prior to May 11, 1990, there was no generally available hose small, strong, and flexible enough for the Canadian application. The jury also reasonably could have found that, during the May 11, 1990 meeting, FMI disclosed to BWC that it had developed such a hose; that the hose was constructed from a unique \"recipe\" involving a nylon core, a double-braided sheath of Kevlar, and a polyurethane coating; and that U.S. Composites had successfully manufactured the hose. Finally, the jury reasonably could have found that the hose was the culmination of nearly two years of research and development, and that the hose would give FMI a significant leg up in bidding on Ontario Hydro's sludge removal business, which the utility clearly regarded as an urgent and time-sensitive problem. If indeed the jury made these permissible findings, it was entitled to conclude that a reasonable person would regard FMI's hose technology as both likely to be appreciated only by its possession and something FMI would have wanted to keep from its only competitor for the sludge removal contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the second question, the very fact that FMI compelled BWC and U.S. Composites to sign confidentiality agreements prior to making any disclosures allowed the jury to conclude that FMI had manifested a subjective expectation that the hose technology would be kept confidential. In so ruling, we acknowledge that Leary's openness with St. Louis at and after the May 11, 1990 meeting seems to undermine FMI's claim that it regarded as confidential the information disclosed in the Leary/St. Louis conversations. But in the end, we think that the jury reasonably could have regarded Leary's disclosures as unusual revelations of protected information during an unusual period of cooperation between competitors, made more freely because of Leary's knowledge of the signed confidentiality agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, with respect to the third question, we believe that the jury reasonably could have found that the information Leary related to St. Louis at the May 11, 1990 meeting was neither known within the hose industry \"in its disclosed combinations\" nor obtainable from public information with reasonable ease. In making its public domain argument, BWC understandably focuses on the fact that, generally speaking, there was at the relevant point in time nothing secret about constructing a hose with a nylon core, a Kevlar braid, and polyurethane. But nothing in the instructions required the jury to decide the public domain issue at this level of generality. Rather, we think that, as instructed, the jury was entitled ask itself a much more specific question: On May 11, 1990, could an interested party have learned with reasonable ease from publicly available information that there existed a polyurethane-coated, Kevlar-reinforced nylon hose that was small, strong, and flexible enough to remove sludge within even the tiny gaps between the tube bundles in Canadian nuclear reactors? The evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the jury's negative response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of BWC's primary argument, we turn to its alternative challenges to the district court's denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law. BWC's first alternative argument is that, even if FMI disclosed confidential information on May 11, 1990, BWC never \"used\" the information in violation of the agreement because BWC engineers did not \"incorporate\" the information into the BWC hose. (BWC Brief at 35.) We recognize that, in addressing BWC's motion, the trial judge accepted that incorporation was the standard by which the jury should have gauged whether there had been an unlawful use. See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, No. 93-12465-RGS, at 6-7 (D. Mass. December 31, 1998) (memorandum of decision and order on defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law). The court reached this conclusion because, in its opinion, FMI had argued exclusively at trial that there had been such an incorporation. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118178\"><a href=\"/opinion/118178/bogan-v-scott-harris/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> But even </a></span>if we shared the lower court's view of the trial record, we would disagree with its conclusion. Theories presented in opening and closing arguments do not necessarily curb a jury's discretion in this way. As we already have stated, a jury verdict will stand so long as the evidence makes it reasonable under \"any permissible claim or theory.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755758\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Collazo-Santiago,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/755758/prodliabrep-cch-p-15280-diana-collazo-santiago-v-toyota-motor-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">27</span> </a></span>(emphasis supplied). Here, the jury was not asked to find incorporation; it more broadly was asked, without objection from BWC, whether BWC \"used\" the information in violation of the agreement. BWC cannot now complain that the jury may have understood the term \"use\" in its ordinary sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So viewed, the use issue is not close. There was abundant evidence that BWC developed its hose far more quickly than otherwise would have been possible because it started with and proceeded from the knowledge that a viable hose could be constructed from nylon, Kevlar, and polyurethane. Moreover, there was evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found that BWC \"used\" the May 11, 1990 disclosure of U.S. Composites as the hose manufacturer to obtain an FMI hose sample from U.S. Composites, test the sample, and apply the test results in developing its own hose. Thus, the evidence adequately supported the jury's conclusion that BWC wrongfully used the confidential information disclosed on May 11, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pointing to evidence that Ontario Hydro in fact owned the hose technology at issue in this case, BWC next contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion that the technology was proprietary to FMI under Massachusetts law. In BWC's view, one cannot protect under a confidentiality agreement that which one does not own. BWC did not, however, present this argument to the lower court when it moved for judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we deem the argument waived. See, e.g., Hammond v. T.J. Litle &amp; Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717545\"><a href=\"/opinion/717545/scott-p-hammond-v-tj-litle-company-inc-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span>, 1171 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, BWC argues that it should prevail because FMI did not formally designate an expert to testify as to liability issues. More particularly, BWC takes the position that expert testimony was required for the jury rationally to have answered whether (1) the \"combination of materials [in the FMI hose was] an idea so unique that an engineer with the appropriate training and experience could . . . readily discover it\"; and (2) \"BWC had incorporated aspects of the FMI hose that were proprietary to FMI.\" (BWC Brief at 47-48 (emphasis in original)). But as we have explained, these questions - which again are based on the premise that the jury was instructed in strict accordance with Massachusetts trade secrets law (or at least BWC's view of such law) - were not questions that the instructions required the jury to answer. Based on our review of the record as a whole, we are satisfied that competent evidence supports the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Admission in Evidence of Lichtman Notes and Failure to Give Curative Instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC asserts that the district court erred in admitting the Lichtman notes in evidence, and then exacerbated its error by failing to give a curative instruction after FMI, in arguing to the jury during its closing that its hose was not an obvious extension of existing technology, used the Lichtman notes in a manner prohibited by the hearsay rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 802 (prohibiting the introduction of hearsay evidence). In BWC's view, the court's failure to give a curative instruction effectively permitted FMI to use inadmissible double hearsay as substantive expert testimony on a crucial liability issue. FMI responds that the Lichtman notes were admitted for two permissible non-hearsay purposes - (1) to show what information Babbitt and Leary had when they conducted their hose searches; and (2) to show the falsity of the vendors' impressions, see United States v. Adkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440118\"><a href=\"/opinion/440118/united-states-v-glen-adkins-aka-alan-perlman-tom-adkins-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span>, 746 (5th Cir. 1984) (\"When statements are introduced to prove the falsity of the matter asserted, they are not inadmissible as hearsay.\") - and, in any event, were properly admitted as a business record. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) (setting forth the \"[r]ecords of regularly conducted business activity\" hearsay exception).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FMI successfully moved the Lichtman notes in evidence during its direct examination of Chip Babbitt. After overruling BWC's objection to admission of the notes, and in response to BWC's subsequent request for a limiting instruction, the district court addressed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jurors, if I can anticipate what [BWC's counsel] is asking me to tell you with respect to this last exhibit, the man - that is, Mr. Lichtman - who prepared these notes upon which this witness relied, because of medical problems, is unavailable to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He had a cerebral hemorrhage so he cannot come into court and testify about the circumstances under which he prepared these notes which contain a fair amount of hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He is in the business of calling on people and asking them certain questions about the availability of this product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm sure what [BWC's counsel] wants me to do is to point this out to you, that while this witness [Chip Babbitt] may have relied on these notes, we are in a position today, even though I've admitted them as evidence, of not being able to go back to their author to really explore the manner in which these notes were assembled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked if this was what BWC's counsel had in mind in requesting the limiting instruction, counsel informed the court: \"It is exactly, your Honor.\" FMI then went on to question Babbitt about the particulars of his hose search, asking whether and why Babbitt did or did not contact vendors with whom Lichtman previously had spoken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The context in which the notes were admitted, the court's admonition that the notes contain \"a fair amount of hearsay,\" and the court's two explicit references to Babbitt relying on the notes, combine to suggest that the court did not admit the Lichtman notes as evidence tending to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein. Instead, these factors make it far more likely that the notes were admitted for the limited purpose of helping to establish the factual context in which Babbitt began his hose search. Admission of the notes for this limited purpose would not have violated the hearsay rule and therefore would have been within the court's discretion. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) (defining hearsay as a \"statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial, or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\"). Moreover, even if the court admitted the notes for a different purpose, the fact that the notes were admissible for the purpose just described is sufficient to support their consideration by a properly instructed jury. See LaBarre v. Shepard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196781\"><a href=\"/opinion/196781/labarre-v-shepard/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 500-01 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[W]e can affirm the admission of evidence on any proper basis, even if the trial judge relied on a different ground.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, whether the notes conceivably could have come into evidence for a proper purpose is a different question from whether the court permitted FMI to use them improperly. And it is on this latter issue that BWC primarily focuses its appellate argument. In particular, BWC complains about the following passage from FMI's closing argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What [FMI] did in 1988 was they called the leading hose companies in the world and said, This is our problem, do you have an answer, which is the way it works in real life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And what we found out was two things: First of all, the top guy in the world, Rogan, from Rogan &amp; Shanley, other vendors refer to Rogan &amp; Shanley as the prime source for small-diameter high-pressure hose, spoke to Lichtman twice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He said there are technical problems which Rogan feels may be insuperable at almost any price. In short, Rogan thinks we're wasting our time. People told Columbus he shouldn't have sailed to America.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC contends that this portion of FMI's closing argument effectively converted Rogan's out-of-court statement (as related by the non-testifying Lichtman) into substantive expert testimony that the hose FMI developed was not an obvious extension of extant, publicly known hose technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's contention fails to take account, however, of the unusual procedural posture in which this issue comes before us. BWC did not object to this argument when it was made. It instead brought the issue up at the sidebar conference following the court's jury instructions, when it asked the district court to repeat its earlier limiting instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[BWC's Counsel]: Your honor, [FMI's counsel] again emphasized the importance of the Lichtman notes in his closing, and we would ask for another cautionary instruction on the hearsay nature of this document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: If he did emphasize it, it [e]luded me completely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[BWC's Counsel]: Your Honor, what [FMI's counsel] did was to take the hearsay portions of those notes, Mr. Rogan, what Mr. Rogan said about this being an impossible task, and used those as expert testimony where, in fact, Mr. Rogan was not before the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[BWC's Counsel]: We understood those were only admitted to show this was the beginning of a hose search and Mr. Rogan - anything of a hearsay nature about what Mr. Rogan believed about the difficulty would not come in as expert testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: Well, I just want to call attention to specific - I'm just going to have to trust that the jury will understand that they have to follow my instructions limiting, excluding, and disregarding evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the question is not whether the court should have instructed the jury to disregard FMI's counsel's argument; it is only whether, in light of unobjected-to interceding events, the court should have repeated its earlier instruction to the effect that the Lichtman notes should only be considered for limited, non-hearsay purposes. The court did not abuse its discretion in declining to repeat what it already had said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Remaining Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's remaining arguments do not require extended discussion. BWC first complains that the district court committed reversible error in instructing the jury on the weighing of \"differ[ing]\" expert testimony because FMI presented no expert testimony as to liability. In rejecting BWC's challenge to its instruction, the court stated that it had given the instruction to guide the jury with respect to the differing testimony given by each side's damages expert.

We thus reject BWC's claim that the court did not evaluate the testimony under Daubert. And having rejected the argument that the court improperly failed to perform its gatekeeping function under Daubert, we also reject as based on a faulty factual premise the argument that the court would have excluded plaintiff's damages expert's testimony had it applied Daubert. In reaching this latter conclusion, we think it significant that BWC has not here challenged the damages verdict as based upon speculative or insufficiently reliable evidence introduced at trial. Indeed, in connection with this issue, BWC's brief makes no mention at all of the testimony FMI's damages expert gave at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BWC's final argument is that the district court abused its discretion in ordering that (1) certain documents produced by FMI during discovery \"be used only for purposes related to the instant litigation\"; and (2) \"any notations made [by FMI] on the documents after their creation be deleted.\" The documents in question were all initially marked confidential by FMI and produced under an agreed-to protective order which limited the parties' ability to use materials so marked. BWC alleges that the documents demonstrate \"that FMI had, on numerous occasions, gained unauthorized access to information about BWC's sludge lance designs and financial information, in some instances by taking it from desks of Ontario Hydro employees or directly off Ontario Hydro's facsimile machines.\" (BWC Brief at 20.) BWC does not suggest that the court's order hampered its trial preparation. Rather, BWC appears interested in using the materials for purposes unrelated to this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever merit there might be to BWC's claimed entitlement to use as it sees fit the documents, complete with FMI's notations thereon, the fact is that BWC never argued such an entitlement to the district court. These documents only were brought to the lower court's attention by means of BWC's \"Motion to Remove Confidential Designations from Certain Documents Produced by Plaintiffs,\" which the court granted subject to the restrictions noted above. In that motion, BWC asserted only that the inaccurate confidential designations were hampering its trial preparation efforts; it in no way argued an entitlement to use the materials for non-litigation related purposes. Moreover, BWC never asked the court to reconsider the restrictions, which were imposed in response to FMI submissions expressing concern that BWC intended to use the materials for such purposes (which submissions BWC did not oppose on grounds of entitlement to use the material for such purposes). Under the circumstances, we regard the argument BWC presses here as waived. See, e.g., National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195818\"><a href=\"/opinion/195818/national-amusements-v-town-of-dedham/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 749 (1st Cir. 1995) (arguments not presented below are waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. FMI's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Denial of Motion for New Trial on Damages</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1994, FMI established a wholly owned subsidiary named Foster-Miller Canada (FMC) to compete for water lancing contracts in Canada. During discovery, FMI acknowledged that FMC, and not FMI, would have bid on any post-March 1994 contracts wrongfully won by BWC as a result of its breach of the confidentiality agreement. FMI's damages expert, without explaining why, included FMC's projected lost profits in arriving at the FMI damages calculations set forth in his report. Prior to trial, BWC moved in limine to preclude FMI from presenting evidence of FMC's lost profits, arguing that FMI alone was the plaintiff and that FMI was not entitled to profits that would have gone to its wholly owned subsidiary. In opposition, FMI simply asserted that \"the law thoroughly and indisputably establishes that a parent/stockholder ([FMI]) can recover damages to a subsidiary/corporation ([FMC]) flowing from breach of an agreement with the parent/stockholder (BWC's agreement with [FMI]) . . . .\" The district court agreed with BWC and barred FMI from presenting testimony regarding FMC's lost profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the verdict, FMI moved for a partial new trial on damages, arguing for the first time that it had been entitled to FMC's lost profits because such profits accurately measured the diminution in the value of FMC caused by BWC's conduct: \"FMI was a 100% shareholder of [FMC, and] profits lost by [FMC] translated, dollar for dollar, into a loss to [FMI] because of the loss in the value of its ownership interest in [FMC].\" (FMI's Motion for Partial New Trial at 4.) In other words, rather than simply asserting an entitlement to its wholly owned subsidiary's lost profits (as it had done prior to trial), FMI now was asserting both an entitlement to the diminution in value of its wholly owned asset, and that the asset's lost profits accurately measured such diminution. In a margin order, the district court rejected this theory as, inter alia, \"raised too late in the game.\" (Id. at 1.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, FMI renews its claimed entitlement to recover the diminished value of BWC. In so arguing, FMI once again asserts that BWC's lost profits are the proper measure of such diminution. But even if we assume arguendo that FMI was entitled to recover FMC's diminished value as part of its damages, we think that the \"FMC's lost profits = FMC's diminished value\" premise of FMI's argument is sufficiently debatable to have required its disclosure to BWC during discovery. Clearly, lost profits and diminished corporate value are distinct concepts, see, e.g., Protectors Ins. Service, Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749845\"><a href=\"/opinion/749845/protectors-insurance-service-inc-a-colorado-corporation-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 617-18 (10th Cir. 1998), and we are not prepared to say that the measure of diminished corporate value will always meet or exceed the measure of the corporation's lost profits. Had FMI afforded BWC notice that it was seeking FMC's lost profits as a measure of FMC's diminished value, BWC would have been afforded the opportunity to develop a competing valuation theory. The district court's decision to reject FMI's theory as untimely was thus within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Discovery Sanction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During discovery, BWC served upon FMI a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deposition notice covering fourteen topics. FMI did not produce witnesses competent to testify as to five of the topics because BWC had in the early stages of the case already deposed the employees FMI regarded as most knowledgeable on those topics. Instead, with respect to these five topics, FMI's counsel wrote BWC's counsel and asked him to specify whether he wanted FMI (1) to recall these witnesses; (2) to produce additional witnesses; or (3) to designate the prior deposition testimony as Rule 30(b)(6) testimony. BWC subsequently moved for an order compelling FMI to comply with its Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice, which the district court granted. The court also awarded BWC the costs and fees it incurred in bringing the motion to compel. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d) (requiring an award of costs and fees upon the granting of such a motion \"unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, FMI argues that its conduct was reasonable under the circumstances and that the district court's sanction was an abuse of its discretion. But our review of the record reveals that the court had reason to conclude that FMI, by asking BWC whom it wished to testify on behalf of FMI for Rule 30(b)(6) purposes (or what testimony it wished FMI to designate as Rule 30(b)(6) testimony), effectively attempted to shift to BWC the onus of identifying who best spoke for FMI on the matters in question. Such a burden shift is contrary to the purposes of Rule 30(b)(6). See Mistui &amp; Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. v. Puerto Rico Water Resources Auth., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></span>, 66-67 (D.P.R. 1981). In any event, FMI cannot and does not deny that, strictly speaking, it failed either to designate witnesses competent to address each of the topics specified in the Rule 30(b)(6) notice or to obtain from the court an appropriate protective order. The court thus did not abuse its discretion in strictly enforcing Rule 30(b)(6). See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Nor did </span>the court abuse its discretion in concluding that FMI's failure to comply with the notice was not \"substantially justified\" within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the orders and judgments appealed from in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
