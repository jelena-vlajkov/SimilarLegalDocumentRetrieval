Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Carlos Garcia on Motion in Opposition to the Respondent’s\nMotion to Dismiss, pro se.\n     Thomas F.

Petitioner-appellant         Carlos     Garcia\n\nappeals the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.                   Having carefully\n\nreviewed the record in this case, we uphold the district\n\ncourt's denial of habeas relief.\n\n            In order to obtain habeas relief in the instant\n\ncase, Garcia must show that the adjudication of his claim\n\n\"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n\nlaw,   as   determined   by     the    Supreme    Court   of   the    United\n\nStates.\"    28 U.S.C. §2254(d)(1).          We discern no rule in the\n\nSupreme Court's Confrontation Clause jurisprudence which\n\ndirectly governs the alleged error in this case.                     Cruz v.\n\nNew York, 481 U.S. 186 (1987), which prohibits the admission\n\nof a codefendant's confession in cases where the defendant's\n\nown    confession   is   also    admitted,       is   inapplicable     since\n\nGarcia did not confess in the instant case.                Richardson v.\n\nMarsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211 (1987) specifically addresses a\n\nsituation in which a nontestifying codefendant's confession\n\nhas been redacted to eliminate all reference to a defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fThe   statement     admitted       in    this   case     contains      specific\n\nreferences to Garcia.\n\n            Since there is no clearly established Supreme Court\n\nlaw   to   which    the    SJC's    decision        in   this   case    can   be\n\n\"contrary,\" we must evaluate Garcia's petition under the\n\n\"unreasonable application\" clause of section 2254(d)(1).\n\nO'Brien    v.    Dubois,    145    F.3d       16,   26   (1st   Cir.     1998).\n\nSpecifically, we must determine whether the SJC decision is\n\n\"objectively reasonable.\"               Williams v. Taylor, 120 S.Ct.\n\n1495, 1520-21 (2000).         For the writ to issue in this case,\n\nthe SJC decision must be \"so devoid of record support, or so\n\narbitrary, as to indicate that it is outside the universe of\n\nplausible, credible outcomes.\"                O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.\n\n\n\n            The SJC relied on the general presumption endorsed\n\nby the Supreme Court that a Confrontation Clause violation\n\nis less likely to occur when, as in the instant case, the\n\nadmitted    statement       does        not   expressly     incriminate        a\n\ndefendant but becomes so only when linked with other trial\n\nevidence.       Richardson, 481 U.S. at 208.             Moreover, again in\n\naccord with Supreme Court doctrine, id. at 211, the SJC paid\n\nprecise attention to the facts of the case and especially to\n\nthe \"clear and forceful\" instructions given to the jury that\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fit   was   not    to   consider   the   statement   against   Garcia,\n\nCommonwealth v. James, 424 Mass. 770, 784, 678 N.E.2d 1170,\n\n1180 (1997).       Nothing in this calculus leads us to believe\n\nthat the SJC's conclusion that no constitutional violation\n\noccurred was \"outside the universe of plausible, credible\n\noutcomes.\"       Hence, there was no unreasonable application of\n\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
