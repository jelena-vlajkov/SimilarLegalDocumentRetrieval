Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n            Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n          Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n          and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJohn D. Hallisey for Mary Virginia Brandt Ruxton et al.\r\nJohn T. Stahr, Dept. of Justice, with whom Lois J Schiffer,\r\nAsst. Attorney General, Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney and\r\nGeorge B. Henderson, II, Asst. United States Attorney, John A.\r\nBryson and Joy Ryan, Attorneys, Dept. of Justice were on brief, for\r\nappellee United States.\r\nArthur C. Croce, for Roger Treat Jackson, Jr., et al. and pro\r\nse.\r\n\nNovember 30, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Mary Brandt Ruxton, the estate of\r\nJean Stevenson Clark, Norman S. Rose, Elmer Q. Rose, Austin L.\r\nRose, and the estate of Priscilla L. Rose (collectively the \"Ruxton\r\nheirs\" or \"Ruxton claimants\") appeal from an order of the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts\r\nestablishing the interest of several dozen claimants in a\r\ncondemnation award.  The Ruxton heirs argue that, in addition to\r\nthe share awarded to them by the trial court, they are entitled to\r\nclaim the interest of absent heirs who did not appear in court and\r\nwhose existence, in some cases,  cannot be confirmed (the \"absent\r\nheirs\").   The Ruxton heirs claim that the district court deprived\r\nthem of this entitlement by ruling that the unclaimed funds would\r\nescheat to the United States. The Ruxton heirs also argue that the\r\ntrial court awarded inadequate attorneys' fees under the common\r\nfund doctrine.  Arthur C. Croce, an attorney representing different\r\nclaimants in an earlier, related, action, also appeals, asserting\r\nthat the trial court erred in concluding that he was not entitled\r\nto attorneys' fees in the instant case.  \r\nWe affirm the district court's order, finding that it did\r\nnot escheat funds to the United States and that it properly\r\napportioned the condemnation award according to largely uncontested\r\ngenealogical evidence.  Pursuant to that order, the Ruxton heirs\r\nmay still claim that they are entitled to collect a portion of the\r\naward reserved for the absent heirs.  Their entitlement to the\r\nfunds of the absent heirs is, therefore, not yet ripe for our\r\nresolution.  We likewise affirm the district court's judgment as to\r\nattorneys' fees.    \r\n                      I.\r\nBackground\r\nThe instant dispute has a long history, discussed also in\r\nour decision in Cadorette v. United States, 988 F.2d 215 (1st Cir.\r\n1993).  Here, we sketch the outlines, focusing on the specifics\r\nrelevant to this dispute.\r\nA. The Land Purchase\r\nIn 1972, the United States purchased eight acres of land\r\nin Truro, Massachusetts (the \"eight acres\") for inclusion in the\r\nCape Cod National Seashore.  Regrettably, the seller of the\r\nproperty, Elizabeth Freeman, owned only a small fraction of the\r\nland she purported to convey.  Elizabeth's great grandfather,\r\nEdmund Freeman (referred to as \"Edmund the Elder\"), had owned 100\r\npercent of the land when he died intestate in 1870.  At his death,\r\nhis three surviving children and the direct descendants of his\r\nfourth child each received an undivided twenty-five percent\r\ninterest in the property.  We shall refer to these four lines as\r\n\"Charles,\" \"Betsy I,\"  \"Edmund  II,\" and \"Richard Sr.\"  These four\r\ntwenty-five percent interests continued to descend over the next\r\ncentury, through more than 100 heirs, most of whom did not know\r\nthat they owned an interest in the eight acres.\r\nB. The Quiet Title Action\r\nThe defects in the land sale came to light in 1984, when\r\nJean Stevenson Clark sued the United States pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n2409(a) to \"quiet title\" to what she claimed was her share in the\r\neight acres. Soon, others intervened in the lawsuit, all claiming\r\nthat they too were heirs of Edmund the Elder and thus owned a share\r\nof the property that Elizabeth had sold to the government.  The\r\ntrial court (Skinner, J.) divided the interests in the property\r\nbased on its reading of the Massachusetts law governing descent and\r\ndistribution. See Cadorette v. United States, 1990 WL 149979 (No.\r\n84-2428-S) (D. Mass Sept. 18, 1990).  The United States appealed,\r\narguing that the trial court misapplied Massachusetts law.  While\r\nthe appeal was pending, the United States filed a complaint in\r\ncondemnation pursuant to 40 U.S.C.  257, seeking to acquire\r\nwhatever interest in the land that it did not own already. \r\nOn appeal, we concluded that the trial court had properly\r\ndistributed the interests of two of the four original heirs to the\r\neight acres, Charles and Richard Sr.   See Cadorette v. United\r\nStates, 988 F.2d 215 (1st Cir. 1993).  That part of the judgment\r\nwas final.  But we vacated the trial court's decision to distribute\r\nthe interest of the other two original heirs, Betsy I and Edmund\r\nII, solely to those litigants who were presently before it.  We\r\nobserved that the district court had learned \"very little\" about\r\nthese two lines and that the record contained \"no evidence of any\r\nsignificant effort to locate, or to provide notice to, the\r\ndescendants of Betsy I or Edmund II.\"  Id. at 219, 221.  Given the\r\nsparsity of information, the district court had inappropriately\r\npresumed that Betsy I and Edmund II's lines had died out, and it\r\nhad been particularly inappropriate to presume that they had died\r\nout during the one seven-year period under which the parties before\r\nthe court would be entitled, under Massachusetts law, to their\r\nentire interest in the land.  See id.\r\nIn Cadorette, we declined to determine \"precisely how\r\nMassachusetts law ought to apply\" because the government had since\r\nfiled a condemnation action.  Id. at 222.  We ruled that the\r\ninitiation of condemnation proceedings mooted the \"quiet title\"\r\ndispute, and thus displaced any further need for the trial court to\r\ndetermine the interest of Betsy I and Edmund II in the quiet title\r\naction. By filing a condemnation action, the government would\r\nacquire the fifty percent interest in the eight acres that had\r\npassed through Betsy I and Edmund II upon payment of \"just\r\ncompensation.\"  See id. at 222-226.  We ruled that upon a further\r\nsearch for heirs of Betsy I and Edmund II, \"the district court\r\nshould determine afresh whom to compensate for those shares.\" Id.\r\nat 222.\r\nC. The Condemnation Proceedings\r\nIn the condemnation proceedings that followed our\r\ndecision in Cadorette, the parties stipulated that the \"just\r\ncompensation\" for Betsy I and Edmund II's fifty percent interest in\r\nthe eight acres was $162,000.  The issue turned, once again, to\r\ndistribution.  The United States presented the findings of its\r\nexpert genealogist, George M. Dallas, who had authored a report\r\ntracing the devolution of ownership interests of Betsy I and Edmund\r\nII (the \"Dallas Report\").  Although Dallas identified some direct\r\ndescendants of Betsy I and Edmund II who had inherited an interest\r\nin the property,  the information about these lines was still\r\nincomplete.  For example, Dallas learned that Betsy I had eleven\r\nchildren between 1830 and 1854 and that she left her estate to\r\nthirteen children and grandchildren.  What became of all of these\r\nheirs, however, was (and is) unknown.  For example, the Dallas\r\nReport concluded that the \"Heirs of William Edward Sargent\" (Betsy\r\nI's grandson) were entitled to a specific share of the eight acres,\r\nbut it failed to specify who those heirs were.  \r\nThe Ruxton heirs did not contest Dallas's genealogical\r\nfindings.  They did, however, file motions arguing that the court\r\nshould award them the shares of heirs whose existence was unknown\r\nand who had failed to appear in court. They argued that given the\r\nfailure of other parties to appear, the trial court should conclude\r\nthat the Ruxton heirs were the closest heirs with a claim to the\r\nproperty and, consequently, award them the interests of the absent\r\nparties pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190  3, governing the\r\nintestate descent and distribution of land.\r\nOn September 28, 1998, the district court (Wolf, J.)\r\nentered an order termed \"Final Judgment of Distribution and\r\nEntitlement\" (the \"Distribution\").  The Distribution divided the\r\ncondemnation proceeds according to the Dallas Report, with only\r\nminor exceptions not relevant here.  Paragraph one of the order\r\ndistributed a portion of the award to the Ruxton heirs, and other\r\nparties before the court, based on the percent that the Dallas\r\nReport stated they had inherited.  Paragraph two specified the\r\ninterests of the absent parties.  Some of these absent parties were\r\nidentified by name and awarded a specific share of the condemnation\r\nproceeds.  Other absent parties, due to the incomplete information\r\nin the Dallas report, were identified merely as heirs of various\r\nBetsy I and Edmund II sub-lines about which little information was\r\nknown after the late 1800s or early 1900s.  For example, the court\r\nawarded the \"Heirs of Amy Swett Higgins\" approximately three\r\npercent of the proceeds.  Dallas had determined that Amy Higgins\r\ndied on January 3, 1878, but he was unable to locate her probate\r\nrecords or determine whether she had children. \r\nIn addition to affirming the Dallas Report's genealogical\r\nevidence, the district court established procedures for the parties\r\nto claim their shares.  The court ruled that \"any person identified\r\nin this paragraph 2 [listing awards for the absent heirs] or any\r\nperson entitled to take such person's share under applicable law\r\nmay, on petition to the court and upon notice to the United States\r\nAttorney and full proof of right thereto, obtain an order directing\r\npayment to him or her.\"  The court also provided that five years\r\nfollowing the date of the judgment, unclaimed funds would be\r\nremoved from the court's own registry and deposited in the Treasury\r\nof the United States, pursuant to 28 U.S.C  2042.  The Ruxton\r\nheirs brought this appeal and Attorney Croce appeals the district\r\ncourt's refusal to award him attorneys' fees.  \r\n                     II.\r\nDistribution of the condemnation award\r\nRather than challenging the specific percentages awarded\r\nin the Distribution, the Ruxton heirs argue that they, as the\r\nclosest heirs to come forward, are entitled to collect the shares\r\nof the absent heirs pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190  3. \r\nSection 3 establishes a hierarchy of claims to an intestate's land,\r\ngiving the first claim to children and grandchildren, then to\r\nparents, then to brothers and sisters and their children.  If none\r\nof these direct heirs exist, the statute provides for inheritance\r\nby \"collateral heirs\": \r\n\n(6) If [the intestate] leaves no issue, and no father, mother,\r\nbrother or sister, and no issue of any deceased brother or\r\nsister, then to his next of kin in equal degree; but if there\r\nare two or more collateral kindred in equal degree claiming\r\nthrough different ancestors, those claiming through the\r\nnearest ancestor shall be preferred to those claiming through\r\nan ancestor more remote.\r\nUnder  3, the Ruxton heirs are \"collateral heirs\" to all of the\r\ndescendants of Betsy I and Edmund II.  Although they are only\r\nremote relatives of some of the absent parties, under  3 they have\r\ninheritance rights to the interests of the absent parties if more\r\ndirect heirs do not exist.  The Ruxton heirs suggest that the non-\r\nappearance of more direct heirs creates a presumption that they do\r\nnot exist, and that their interest in the property would therefore\r\npass to the Ruxton claimants, the closest heirs who have appeared.\r\nThe Ruxton heirs argue that the district court denied\r\nthem their claims to the funds of absent parties by escheating the\r\ninterests of the absent heirs to the United States.  However, the\r\ndistrict court did not award the beneficial interest in these funds\r\nto the United States and the Ruxton heirs' challenge to the\r\nDistribution fails when deprived of this premise.  We start by\r\nanalyzing the escheat claim, and then turn to the language of the\r\nDistribution free from the misconception that it effects an\r\nescheat.\r\nA. 28 U.S.C.  2042 and Escheat\r\nAccording to the Ruxton heirs, the district court\r\neffectuated an escheat by first setting aside approximately two-\r\nthirds of the condemnation award for the absent heirs, and then\r\nstating that these interests, if they went unclaimed for five\r\nyears, would be transferred to the United States Treasury in the\r\nname and credit of the United States, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n2042. If  2042 awarded the interest of the absent heirs to the\r\nUnited States, the Ruxton heirs would have a plausible argument\r\nthat the district court deprived them of their interest in the\r\ncondemnation fund.  But  2042 does no such thing.  While  2042\r\ndoes provide that unclaimed funds will be deposited in the  United\r\nStates Treasury \"in the name and to the credit of the United\r\nStates,\" the statute goes on to state that \"[a]ny claimant entitled\r\nto any such money may, on petition to the court and upon notice to\r\nthe United States attorney and full proof of the right thereto,\r\nobtain an order directing payment to him.\"  The statute does not\r\nextinguish claims to the moneys held in a condemnation fund; it\r\nmerely provides for the transfer of these funds to the United\r\nStates Treasury.  \r\nThe Supreme Court has confirmed that the transfer of\r\nfunds from a district court to a general account in the United\r\nStates Treasury does not extinguish valid claims.  See United\r\nStates v. Klein, 303 U.S. 276, 282 (1938).  In Klein, the state of\r\nPennsylvania sought to collect funds transferred to the United\r\nStates Treasury pursuant to the largely identical predecessor to \r\n2042. The United States argued that since the funds had been\r\ntransferred to the Treasury, Pennsylvania could no longer recover\r\non its claim.  The Court rejected this claim, noting that even\r\nafter deposit in the United States Treasury, \"the fund remains\r\nsubject to the order of the District Court to be paid to the\r\npersons lawfully entitled to it upon proof of their ownership.\" \r\nId. at 280.  Other courts have reached the same conclusion. See In\r\nre Moneys Deposited, 243 F.2d 443, 445 (3d Cir. 1957) (\"[A]lthough\r\nsuch subsequent deposit in the federal Treasury is required by the\r\nstatute to be 'in the name and to the credit of the United States'\r\nthe fact is that the United States has no beneficial interest\r\ntherein but holds the money as statutory trustee for the rightful\r\nowners when and if they are determined by the court.\");United\r\nStates v Iovenelli, 403 F.2d 468, 469 (7th Cir. 1968); Hansen v.\r\nUnited States, 340 F.2d 142, 144 (8th Cir. 1965). \r\nThe language of  2042 and the case law make clear that\r\nthe Ruxton heirs' entitlement to these funds, if any, exists\r\nirrespective of whether the funds sit in the court registry or the\r\nUnited States Treasury.  Although we understand the Ruxton heirs'\r\ndesire to have their allotted interest in the funds of the absent\r\nheirs finally decided, their assertion that the district court has\r\nalready ruled against them by escheating these funds to the United\r\nStates is erroneous.\r\nB. Remaining Challenges to the Distribution\r\nOnce we reject the Ruxton heirs' premise that the funds\r\nescheated, it becomes clear that the district court has not yet\r\nruled on the Ruxton heirs' claims. Rather, the court, after\r\nidentifying the entitlements of the absent parties in paragraph\r\ntwo, left open the question of who could claim their shares.  The\r\ncourt provided:\r\n     Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2042, any person identified in\r\nthis paragraph 2, or any other person entitled to take such\r\nperson's share under applicable law, may, on petition to the\r\ncourt and upon notice to the United States Attorney and full\r\nproof of the right thereto, obtain an order directing payment\r\nto him or her.\" (emphasis added) \r\n\nThis order does not bar the claims of the Ruxton heirs to the\r\nportion of the award set aside for the absent parties.  The Ruxton\r\nheirs, if their claim has merit, are \"identified in paragraph two\"\r\nor are entitled to these shares \"under applicable law.\"  The Ruxton\r\nheirs are actually \"identified\" in some cases because, due to the\r\nimperfect genealogical information, paragraph two often speaks of\r\ncategories of individuals entitled to make claims, such as \"Heirs\r\nof Lucille Elaine Sargent\" or \"Heirs of Lilla Rich Higgins.\"  The\r\nRuxton claimants' central argument is that they are \"heirs\" of\r\nthese individuals and that they should inherit these interests\r\nsince more direct heirs have not appeared.  Nothing in the\r\nDistribution prevents the Ruxton claimants from filing a motion\r\nbelow stating that they are, for example, the \"heirs of Lilla Rich\r\nHiggins\" and thus entitled, under the very terms of the\r\nDistribution, to these funds.  \r\nIn other cases, the Ruxton heirs can claim that they are\r\n\"entitled to take such person's share under applicable law.\" The\r\nRuxton heirs can rely on this provision of the Distribution to take\r\nthe share of individuals who were specifically named in paragraph\r\ntwo but who have not appeared in court (for example, John S.\r\nHiggins and Richard H. Farmer). The Ruxton heirs have argued that\r\nthe failure of these individuals to appear creates a presumption in\r\nMassachusetts law that they do not exist, and gives the Ruxton\r\nheirs an entitlement to claim their shares \"under applicable law.\" \r\nThus, in cases where the absent parties are specifically named, as\r\nwell as those in which they are identified merely by category,  the\r\nDistribution does not foreclose the Ruxton heirs' Massachusetts\r\nlaw-based claims.  \r\n Although we conclude that the Distribution does not\r\nforeclose the Ruxton heirs' claims, we are not unsympathetic to\r\ntheir predicament.  The Ruxton heirs have moved on several\r\noccasions to collect the portion of the fund set aside for absent\r\nparties.  Nonetheless, there is no ruling of the court that bars\r\nthem from asserting a claim under the terms set forth in the\r\nDistribution, or otherwise conclusively determines that they could\r\nnot collect the shares of the absent heirs.  Indeed, the record is\r\ndevoid of any indication that the district court evaluated  whether\r\nthe funds set aside for absent parties could be claimed by\r\n\"collateral heirs.\"  Given our involvement with this \"collateral\r\nheirs\" issue in the Cadorette appeal, and our remand with the\r\ninstruction that the parties relitigate their claims, we conclude\r\nthat the silence below cannot be construed as an implicit denial of\r\nthe claims of the Ruxton heirs.  Clearly, the district court cannot\r\ndefer indefinitely a ruling on the Ruxton heirs' claims.  At the\r\nsame time, as we noted in Cadorette, \"the court apparently retains\r\na degree of freedom to divide compensation (and to condition its\r\ndistribution) in a manner that seems fair, in light of the\r\npossibility that 'lost' heirs may eventually appear.\" 988 F.2d at\r\n224. Thus it was not error for the court to order that the funds be\r\ndistributed in accordance with the uncontested genealogical\r\nevidence and then wait some additional time to see which, if any,\r\nadditional heirs appear.   \r\n There remains the question of the finality of the\r\nDistribution for purposes of appeal.  See Catlin v. United States,\r\n324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945) (\"[O]rdinarily in condemnation proceedings\r\nappellate review may be had only upon an order or judgment\r\ndisposing of the whole case . . . . \").  Although we have rejected\r\nthe escheat argument and concluded that the district court has not\r\nyet ruled on the Ruxton heirs' claims, we affirm the judgment as\r\nfinal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1291.  The judgment is final in that\r\nit conclusively (1) determines title to the eight acres, (2)\r\nestablishes the just compensation for that land, and (3)\r\nestablishes a right to collect those funds on the basis of\r\nessentially undisputed genealogical evidence.  The fact that the\r\nDistribution does not always identify the specific individuals\r\nentitled to bring claims against the fund (instead referring to\r\n\"Heirs of x\" and to absent individuals whose existence is unknown)\r\ndoes not defeat that finality.  The attenuated interests in this\r\ncase make it difficult to establish with precision the claimants to\r\nthis fund.  It thus made sense for the district court to determine\r\nfinally the genealogical breakdown before evaluating individual\r\nclaims that may fall under this breakdown. This approach is\r\nanalogous to that used in a complex class action, where a court may\r\nenter a final judgment establishing an award for the class, but\r\nleave for further hearings individual proof of class membership.\r\nSee, e.g. In re \"Agent Orange\" Product Liability Litigation, 818\r\nF.2d 179, 181 (2d Cir. 1987) (reviewing as final a class action\r\ndistribution plan for victims of \"Agent Orange\" even though the\r\nidentification and entitlement of all class members had not yet\r\nbeen determined). \r\nThe Ruxton heirs are free to return to the district court\r\nand assert their claims to the funds of the absent parties.  As we\r\nnoted in Cadorette, these claims raise the question of how best to\r\napply the Massachusetts law of descent and distribution to a\r\nsituation of considerable factual complexity.  We will leave that\r\ndetermination, in the first instance, to the district court.\r\n                    III.\r\nAttorneys' Fees\r\nThe Ruxton heirs argue that the district court awarded\r\ninadequate fees to their attorney, John Hallisey, under the \"common\r\nfund\" doctrine.  Attorney Arthur Croce separately appeals, claiming\r\nthat the district court improperly denied him a share of the common\r\nfund.  \r\nA common fund award \"is an equitable award made at the\r\ndiscretion of the district court.\"  Kargman v. Sullivan, 589 F.2d\r\n63, 69 (1st. Cir. 1978).  \"Moreover, because each common fund case\r\npresents its own unique set of circumstances, trial courts must\r\nassess each request for fees and expenses on its own terms.\" In re\r\nFidelity/Micron Securities Litig., 167 F.3d 735, 737 (1st Cir.\r\n1999).  The trial court enjoys \"extremely broad\" latitude in\r\ndetermining the appropriate shares of the common fund, and may\r\ncalculate such an award either on the basis of a reasonable\r\npercentage of the fund, or using a lodestar method to multiply a\r\nreasonable hourly rate by the compensable hours the attorney worked\r\non the matter.  In re Thirteen Appeals Arising out of the San Juan\r\nDupont Plaza Hotel Fire, 56 F.3d 295, 307, 309 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nawarding Hallisey $37,500, approximately twenty-three percent of\r\nthe $168,000 common fund.  In reaching this decision, the district\r\ncourt closely reviewed the hours Hallisey worked generating the\r\ncondemnation fund, and used these hours to generate a \"lodestar\"\r\nfee (250 hours multiplied by $150 per hour).  The district court\r\nthen concluded that this fee amounted to a reasonable percentage of\r\nthe common fund and was \"consistent with the court's evaluation of\r\nHallisey's contribution to the case.\"  We find this fee to be\r\nreasonable, and we are unwilling to second-guess the district\r\ncourt's assessment of Hallisey's efforts.\r\nLikewise, the court did not abuse its discretion in\r\ndenying Croce any award under the common fund doctrine.  The court\r\nfound that although Croce had generated a portion of the award in\r\nthe Cadorette quiet title action (where he had been compensated),\r\nhis submissions in the condemnation proceedings \"were not valuable\r\nto this court\" and that \"it was evident from the outset that Croce\r\nwas involved to pursue his interest in obtaining attorney's fees.\" \r\nIndeed, Croce represented only nominal parties in the condemnation\r\naction who themselves received no compensation.  Given the district\r\ncourt's findings, there was no abuse of discretion in denying Croce\r\na share of the common fund.   \r\nAFFIRMED.\n",

Rose, Austin L.\r\nRose, and the estate of Priscilla L. Rose (collectively the \"Ruxton\r\nheirs\" or \"Ruxton claimants\") appeal from an order of the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts\r\nestablishing the interest of several dozen claimants in a\r\ncondemnation award.  The Ruxton heirs argue that, in addition to\r\nthe share awarded to them by the trial court, they are entitled to\r\nclaim the interest of absent heirs who did not appear in court and\r\nwhose existence, in some cases,  cannot be confirmed (the \"absent\r\nheirs\").   The Ruxton heirs claim that the district court deprived\r\nthem of this entitlement by ruling that the unclaimed funds would\r\nescheat to the United States. The Ruxton heirs also argue that the\r\ntrial court awarded inadequate attorneys' fees under the common\r\nfund doctrine.  Arthur C. Croce, an attorney representing different\r\nclaimants in an earlier, related, action, also appeals, asserting\r\nthat the trial court erred in concluding that he was not entitled\r\nto attorneys' fees in the instant case.  \r\nWe affirm the district court's order, finding that it did\r\nnot escheat funds to the United States and that it properly\r\napportioned the condemnation award according to largely uncontested\r\ngenealogical evidence.  Pursuant to that order, the Ruxton heirs\r\nmay still claim that they are entitled to collect a portion of the\r\naward reserved for the absent heirs.  Their entitlement to the\r\nfunds of the absent heirs is, therefore, not yet ripe for our\r\nresolution.  We likewise affirm the district court's judgment as to\r\nattorneys' fees.    \r\n                      I.\r\nBackground\r\nThe instant dispute has a long history, discussed also in\r\nour decision in Cadorette v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602340\"><a href=\"/opinion/602340/albert-j-cadorette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir.\r\n1993).  Here, we sketch the outlines, focusing on the specifics\r\nrelevant to this dispute.\r\nA. The Land Purchase\r\nIn 1972, the United States purchased eight acres of land\r\nin Truro, Massachusetts (the \"eight acres\") for inclusion in the\r\nCape Cod National Seashore.  Regrettably, the seller of the\r\nproperty, Elizabeth Freeman, owned only a small fraction of the\r\nland she purported to convey.  Elizabeth's great grandfather,\r\nEdmund Freeman (referred to as \"Edmund the Elder\"), had owned 100\r\npercent of the land when he died intestate in 1870.  At his death,\r\nhis three surviving children and the direct descendants of his\r\nfourth child each received an undivided twenty-five percent\r\ninterest in the property.  We shall refer to these four lines as\r\n\"Charles,\" \"Betsy I,\"  \"Edmund  II,\" and \"Richard Sr.\"  These four\r\ntwenty-five percent interests continued to descend over the next\r\ncentury, through more than 100 heirs, most of whom did not know\r\nthat they owned an interest in the eight acres.\r\nB. The Quiet Title Action\r\nThe defects in the land sale came to light in 1984, when\r\nJean Stevenson Clark sued the United States pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n2409(a) to \"quiet title\" to what she claimed was her share in the\r\neight acres. Soon, others intervened in the lawsuit, all claiming\r\nthat they too were heirs of Edmund the Elder and thus owned a share\r\nof the property that Elizabeth had sold to the government.  The\r\ntrial court (Skinner, J.) divided the interests in the property\r\nbased on its reading of the Massachusetts law governing descent and\r\ndistribution. See Cadorette v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">149979</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(No.\r\n84-2428-S) (D. Mass Sept. 18, 1990).  The United States appealed,\r\narguing that the trial court misapplied Massachusetts law.  While\r\nthe appeal was pending, the United States filed a complaint in\r\ncondemnation pursuant to 40 U.S.C.  257, seeking to acquire\r\nwhatever interest in the land that it did not own already. \r\nOn appeal, we concluded that the trial court had properly\r\ndistributed the interests of two of the four original heirs to the\r\neight acres, Charles and Richard Sr.   See Cadorette v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602340\"><a href=\"/opinion/602340/albert-j-cadorette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir. 1993).  That part of the judgment\r\nwas final.  But we vacated the trial court's decision to distribute\r\nthe interest of the other two original heirs, Betsy I and Edmund\r\nII, solely to those litigants who were presently before it.  We\r\nobserved that the district court had learned \"very little\" about\r\nthese two lines and that the record contained \"no evidence of any\r\nsignificant effort to locate, or to provide notice to, the\r\ndescendants of Betsy I or Edmund II.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602340\"><a href=\"/opinion/602340/albert-j-cadorette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 219, </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">221.  Given the\r\nsparsity of information, the district court had inappropriately\r\npresumed that Betsy I and Edmund II's lines had died out, and it\r\nhad been particularly inappropriate to presume that they had died\r\nout during the one seven-year period under which the parties before\r\nthe court would be entitled, under Massachusetts law, to their\r\nentire interest in the land.

The Condemnation Proceedings\r\nIn the condemnation proceedings that followed our\r\ndecision in Cadorette, the parties stipulated that the \"just\r\ncompensation\" for Betsy I and Edmund II's fifty percent interest in\r\nthe eight acres was $162,000.  The issue turned, once again, to\r\ndistribution.  The United States presented the findings of its\r\nexpert genealogist, George M. Dallas, who had authored a report\r\ntracing the devolution of ownership interests of Betsy I and Edmund\r\nII (the \"Dallas Report\").  Although Dallas identified some direct\r\ndescendants of Betsy I and Edmund II who had inherited an interest\r\nin the property,  the information about these lines was still\r\nincomplete.  For example, Dallas learned that Betsy I had eleven\r\nchildren between 1830 and 1854 and that she left her estate to\r\nthirteen children and grandchildren.  What became of all of these\r\nheirs, however, was (and is) unknown.  For example, the Dallas\r\nReport concluded that the \"Heirs of William Edward Sargent\" (Betsy\r\nI's grandson) were entitled to a specific share of the eight acres,\r\nbut it failed to specify who those heirs were.  \r\nThe Ruxton heirs did not contest Dallas's genealogical\r\nfindings.  They did, however, file motions arguing that the court\r\nshould award them the shares of heirs whose existence was unknown\r\nand who had failed to appear in court. They argued that given the\r\nfailure of other parties to appear, the trial court should conclude\r\nthat the Ruxton heirs were the closest heirs with a claim to the\r\nproperty and, consequently, award them the interests of the absent\r\nparties pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190  3, governing the\r\nintestate descent and distribution of land.\r\nOn September 28, 1998, the district court (Wolf, J.)\r\nentered an order termed \"Final Judgment of Distribution and\r\nEntitlement\" (the \"Distribution\").  The Distribution divided the\r\ncondemnation proceeds according to the Dallas Report, with only\r\nminor exceptions not relevant here.  Paragraph one of the order\r\ndistributed a portion of the award to the Ruxton heirs, and other\r\nparties before the court, based on the percent that the Dallas\r\nReport stated they had inherited.  Paragraph two specified the\r\ninterests of the absent parties.  Some of these absent parties were\r\nidentified by name and awarded a specific share of the condemnation\r\nproceeds.  Other absent parties, due to the incomplete information\r\nin the Dallas report, were identified merely as heirs of various\r\nBetsy I and Edmund II sub-lines about which little information was\r\nknown after the late 1800s or early 1900s.  For example, the court\r\nawarded the \"Heirs of Amy Swett Higgins\" approximately three\r\npercent of the proceeds.  Dallas had determined that Amy Higgins\r\ndied on January 3, 1878, but he was unable to locate her probate\r\nrecords or determine whether she had children. \r\nIn addition to affirming the Dallas Report's genealogical\r\nevidence, the district court established procedures for the parties\r\nto claim their shares.  The court ruled that \"any person identified\r\nin this paragraph 2 [listing awards for the absent heirs] or any\r\nperson entitled to take such person's share under applicable law\r\nmay, on petition to the court and upon notice to the United States\r\nAttorney and full proof of right thereto, obtain an order directing\r\npayment to him or her.\"  The court also provided that five years\r\nfollowing the date of the judgment, unclaimed funds would be\r\nremoved from the court's own registry and deposited in the Treasury\r\nof the United States, pursuant to 28 U.S.C  2042.  The Ruxton\r\nheirs brought this appeal and Attorney Croce appeals the district\r\ncourt's refusal to award him attorneys' fees.  \r\n                     II.\r\nDistribution of the condemnation award\r\nRather than challenging the specific percentages awarded\r\nin the Distribution, the Ruxton heirs argue that they, as the\r\nclosest heirs to come forward, are entitled to collect the shares\r\nof the absent heirs pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190  3. \r\nSection 3 establishes a hierarchy of claims to an intestate's land,\r\ngiving the first claim to children and grandchildren, then to\r\nparents, then to brothers and sisters and their children.  If none\r\nof these direct heirs exist, the statute provides for inheritance\r\nby \"collateral heirs\": \r\n\n(6) If [the intestate] leaves no issue, and no father, mother,\r\nbrother or sister, and no issue of any deceased brother or\r\nsister, then to his next of kin in equal degree; but if there\r\nare two or more collateral kindred in equal degree claiming\r\nthrough different ancestors, those claiming through the\r\nnearest ancestor shall be preferred to those claiming through\r\nan ancestor more remote.\r\nUnder  3, the Ruxton heirs are \"collateral heirs\" to all of the\r\ndescendants of Betsy I and Edmund II.  Although they are only\r\nremote relatives of some of the absent parties, under  3 they have\r\ninheritance rights to the interests of the absent parties if more\r\ndirect heirs do not exist.  The Ruxton heirs suggest that the non-\r\nappearance of more direct heirs creates a presumption that they do\r\nnot exist, and that their interest in the property would therefore\r\npass to the Ruxton claimants, the closest heirs who have appeared.\r\nThe Ruxton heirs argue that the district court denied\r\nthem their claims to the funds of absent parties by escheating the\r\ninterests of the absent heirs to the United States.  However, the\r\ndistrict court did not award the beneficial interest in these funds\r\nto the United States and the Ruxton heirs' challenge to the\r\nDistribution fails when deprived of this premise.  We start by\r\nanalyzing the escheat claim, and then turn to the language of the\r\nDistribution free from the misconception that it effects an\r\nescheat.\r\nA. 28 U.S.C.  2042 and Escheat\r\nAccording to the Ruxton heirs, the district court\r\neffectuated an escheat by first setting aside approximately two-\r\nthirds of the condemnation award for the absent heirs, and then\r\nstating that these interests, if they went unclaimed for five\r\nyears, would be transferred to the United States Treasury in the\r\nname and credit of the United States, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n2042. If  2042 awarded the interest of the absent heirs to the\r\nUnited States, the Ruxton heirs would have a plausible argument\r\nthat the district court deprived them of their interest in the\r\ncondemnation fund.  But  2042 does no such thing.  While  2042\r\ndoes provide that unclaimed funds will be deposited in the  United\r\nStates Treasury \"in the name and to the credit of the United\r\nStates,\" the statute goes on to state that \"[a]ny claimant entitled\r\nto any such money may, on petition to the court and upon notice to\r\nthe United States attorney and full proof of the right thereto,\r\nobtain an order directing payment to him.\"  The statute does not\r\nextinguish claims to the moneys held in a condemnation fund; it\r\nmerely provides for the transfer of these funds to the United\r\nStates Treasury.  \r\nThe Supreme Court has confirmed that the transfer of\r\nfunds from a district court to a general account in the United\r\nStates Treasury does not extinguish valid claims.  See United\r\nStates v. Klein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102975\"><a href=\"/opinion/102975/united-states-v-klein/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 282 (1938).  In Klein, the state of\r\nPennsylvania sought to collect funds transferred to the United\r\nStates Treasury pursuant to the largely identical predecessor to \r\n2042. The United States argued that since the funds had been\r\ntransferred to the Treasury, Pennsylvania could no longer recover\r\non its claim.  The Court rejected this claim, noting that even\r\nafter deposit in the United States Treasury, \"the fund remains\r\nsubject to the order of the District Court to be paid to the\r\npersons lawfully entitled to it upon proof of their ownership.\" \r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102975\"><a href=\"/opinion/102975/united-states-v-klein/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 280. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Other courts have reached the same conclusion. See In\r\nre Moneys Deposited, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"241975\"><a href=\"/opinion/241975/matter-of-moneys-deposited-in-and-now-under-the-control-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445 (3d Cir. 1957) (\"[A]lthough\r\nsuch subsequent deposit in the federal Treasury is required by the\r\nstatute to be 'in the name and to the credit of the United States'\r\nthe fact is that the United States has no beneficial interest\r\ntherein but holds the money as statutory trustee for the rightful\r\nowners when and if they are determined by the court.\");United\r\nStates v Iovenelli, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"282302\"><a href=\"/opinion/282302/united-states-v-ralph-iovenelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469 (7th Cir. 1968); Hansen v.\r\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"266486\"><a href=\"/opinion/266486/melvin-b-hansen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 144 (8th Cir. 1965). \r\nThe language of  2042 and the case law make clear that\r\nthe Ruxton heirs' entitlement to these funds, if any, exists\r\nirrespective of whether the funds sit in the court registry or the\r\nUnited States Treasury.  Although we understand the Ruxton heirs'\r\ndesire to have their allotted interest in the funds of the absent\r\nheirs finally decided, their assertion that the district court has\r\nalready ruled against them by escheating these funds to the United\r\nStates is erroneous.\r\nB. Remaining Challenges to the Distribution\r\nOnce we reject the Ruxton heirs' premise that the funds\r\nescheated, it becomes clear that the district court has not yet\r\nruled on the Ruxton heirs' claims. Rather, the court, after\r\nidentifying the entitlements of the absent parties in paragraph\r\ntwo, left open the question of who could claim their shares.  The\r\ncourt provided:\r\n     Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2042, any person identified in\r\nthis paragraph 2, or any other person entitled to take such\r\nperson's share under applicable law, may, on petition to the\r\ncourt and upon notice to the United States Attorney and full\r\nproof of the right thereto, obtain an order directing payment\r\nto him or her.\" (emphasis added) \r\n\nThis order does not bar the claims of the Ruxton heirs to the\r\nportion of the award set aside for the absent parties.  The Ruxton\r\nheirs, if their claim has merit, are \"identified in paragraph two\"\r\nor are entitled to these shares \"under applicable law.\"  The Ruxton\r\nheirs are actually \"identified\" in some cases because, due to the\r\nimperfect genealogical information, paragraph two often speaks of\r\ncategories of individuals entitled to make claims, such as \"Heirs\r\nof Lucille Elaine Sargent\" or \"Heirs of Lilla Rich Higgins.\"  The\r\nRuxton claimants' central argument is that they are \"heirs\" of\r\nthese individuals and that they should inherit these interests\r\nsince more direct heirs have not appeared.  Nothing in the\r\nDistribution prevents the Ruxton claimants from filing a motion\r\nbelow stating that they are, for example, the \"heirs of Lilla Rich\r\nHiggins\" and thus entitled, under the very terms of the\r\nDistribution, to these funds.  \r\nIn other cases, the Ruxton heirs can claim that they are\r\n\"entitled to take such person's share under applicable law.\" The\r\nRuxton heirs can rely on this provision of the Distribution to take\r\nthe share of individuals who were specifically named in paragraph\r\ntwo but who have not appeared in court (for example, John S.\r\nHiggins and Richard H. Farmer). The Ruxton heirs have argued that\r\nthe failure of these individuals to appear creates a presumption in\r\nMassachusetts law that they do not exist, and gives the Ruxton\r\nheirs an entitlement to claim their shares \"under applicable law.\" \r\nThus, in cases where the absent parties are specifically named, as\r\nwell as those in which they are identified merely by category,  the\r\nDistribution does not foreclose the Ruxton heirs' Massachusetts\r\nlaw-based claims.  \r\n Although we conclude that the Distribution does not\r\nforeclose the Ruxton heirs' claims, we are not unsympathetic to\r\ntheir predicament.  The Ruxton heirs have moved on several\r\noccasions to collect the portion of the fund set aside for absent\r\nparties.  Nonetheless, there is no ruling of the court that bars\r\nthem from asserting a claim under the terms set forth in the\r\nDistribution, or otherwise conclusively determines that they could\r\nnot collect the shares of the absent heirs.  Indeed, the record is\r\ndevoid of any indication that the district court evaluated  whether\r\nthe funds set aside for absent parties could be claimed by\r\n\"collateral heirs.\"  Given our involvement with this \"collateral\r\nheirs\" issue in the Cadorette appeal, and our remand with the\r\ninstruction that the parties relitigate their claims, we conclude\r\nthat the silence below cannot be construed as an implicit denial of\r\nthe claims of the Ruxton heirs.  Clearly, the district court cannot\r\ndefer indefinitely a ruling on the Ruxton heirs' claims.  At the\r\nsame time, as we noted in Cadorette, \"the court apparently retains\r\na degree of freedom to divide compensation (and to condition its\r\ndistribution) in a manner that seems fair, in light of the\r\npossibility that 'lost' heirs may eventually </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602340\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">appear.\"</span> <a href=\"/opinion/602340/albert-j-cadorette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at\r\n<span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Thus it was not error for the court to order that the funds be\r\ndistributed in accordance with the uncontested genealogical\r\nevidence and then wait some additional time to see which, if any,\r\nadditional heirs appear.   \r\n There remains the question of the finality of the\r\nDistribution for purposes of appeal.  See Catlin v. United States,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104095\"><a href=\"/opinion/104095/catlin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233 (1945) (\"[O]rdinarily in condemnation proceedings\r\nappellate review may be had only upon an order or judgment\r\ndisposing of the whole case . . . . \").  Although we have rejected\r\nthe escheat argument and concluded that the district court has not\r\nyet ruled on the Ruxton heirs' claims, we affirm the judgment as\r\nfinal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1291.  The judgment is final in that\r\nit conclusively (1) determines title to the eight acres, (2)\r\nestablishes the just compensation for that land, and (3)\r\nestablishes a right to collect those funds on the basis of\r\nessentially undisputed genealogical evidence.  The fact that the\r\nDistribution does not always identify the specific individuals\r\nentitled to bring claims against the fund (instead referring to\r\n\"Heirs of x\" and to absent individuals whose existence is unknown)\r\ndoes not defeat that finality.  The attenuated interests in this\r\ncase make it difficult to establish with precision the claimants to\r\nthis fund.  It thus made sense for the district court to determine\r\nfinally the genealogical breakdown before evaluating individual\r\nclaims that may fall under this breakdown. This approach is\r\nanalogous to that used in a complex class action, where a court may\r\nenter a final judgment establishing an award for the class, but\r\nleave for further hearings individual proof of class membership.\r\nSee, e.g. In re \"Agent Orange\" Product Liability Litigation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488027\"><a href=\"/opinion/488027/in-re-agent-orange-product-liability-litigation-mdl-no-381/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181 (2d Cir. 1987) (reviewing as final a class action\r\ndistribution plan for victims of \"Agent Orange\" even though the\r\nidentification and entitlement of all class members had not yet\r\nbeen determined). \r\nThe Ruxton heirs are free to return to the district court\r\nand assert their claims to the funds of the absent parties.  As we\r\nnoted in Cadorette, these claims raise the question of how best to\r\napply the Massachusetts law of descent and distribution to a\r\nsituation of considerable factual complexity.  We will leave that\r\ndetermination, in the first instance, to the district court.\r\n                    III.\r\nAttorneys' Fees\r\nThe Ruxton heirs argue that the district court awarded\r\ninadequate fees to their attorney, John Hallisey, under the \"common\r\nfund\" doctrine.  Attorney Arthur Croce separately appeals, claiming\r\nthat the district court improperly denied him a share of the common\r\nfund.  \r\nA common fund award \"is an equitable award made at the\r\ndiscretion of the district court.\"  Kargman v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362201\"><a href=\"/opinion/362201/max-r-kargman-v-thomas-a-sullivan-sarah-wean-intervenors-two-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 (1st. Cir. 1978).  \"Moreover, because each common fund case\r\npresents its own unique set of circumstances, trial courts must\r\nassess each request for fees and expenses on its own terms.\" In re\r\nFidelity/Micron Securities Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198332\"><a href=\"/opinion/198332/weisburgh-v-fidelity-magellan/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (1st Cir.\r\n1999).  The trial court enjoys \"extremely broad\" latitude in\r\ndetermining the appropriate shares of the common fund, and may\r\ncalculate such an award either on the basis of a reasonable\r\npercentage of the fund, or using a lodestar method to multiply a\r\nreasonable hourly rate by the compensable hours the attorney worked\r\non the matter.  In re Thirteen Appeals Arising out of the San Juan\r\nDupont Plaza Hotel Fire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697253\"><a href=\"/opinion/697253/in-re-thirteen-appeals-arising-out-of-the-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307, 309 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nawarding Hallisey $37,500, approximately twenty-three percent of\r\nthe $168,000 common fund.  In reaching this decision, the district\r\ncourt closely reviewed the hours Hallisey worked generating the\r\ncondemnation fund, and used these hours to generate a \"lodestar\"\r\nfee (250 hours multiplied by $150 per hour).  The district court\r\nthen concluded that this fee amounted to a reasonable percentage of\r\nthe common fund and was \"consistent with the court's evaluation of\r\nHallisey's contribution to the case.\"  We find this fee to be\r\nreasonable, and we are unwilling to second-guess the district\r\ncourt's assessment of Hallisey's efforts.\r\nLikewise, the court did not abuse its discretion in\r\ndenying Croce any award under the common fund doctrine.  The court\r\nfound that although Croce had generated a portion of the award in\r\nthe Cadorette quiet title action (where he had been compensated),\r\nhis submissions in the condemnation proceedings \"were not valuable\r\nto this court\" and that \"it was evident from the outset that Croce\r\nwas involved to pursue his interest in obtaining attorney's fees.\" \r\nIndeed, Croce represented only nominal parties in the condemnation\r\naction who themselves received no compensation.  Given the district\r\ncourt's findings, there was no abuse of discretion in denying Croce\r\na share of the common fund.   \r\nAFFIRMED.\n</pre>",
