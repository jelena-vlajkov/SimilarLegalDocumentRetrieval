MALONEY, ET AL.,\r\n\n                   Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n        APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n        [Hon. Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Lance Hullum on brief pro se.\r\n   Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and Susanne G. Levsen,\r\nAssistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau, on brief for\r\nappellees.\r\n\nSeptember 16, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Petitioner Lance Hullum appeals from the\r\ndismissal of his habeas petition filed under 28 U.S.C.  2254. \r\nThe  district court, applying the one-year limitations period\r\nintroduced by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\r\nof 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U.S.C.  2244(d), concluded that the\r\npetition was time-barred, see Hullum v. Maloney, 14 F. Supp. 2d\r\n164 (D. Mass. 1998) (adopting report of the magistrate-judge). \r\nIt thereafter granted a certificate of appealability (COA).  We\r\naffirm but on different grounds.\r\n          Petitioner, who seeks to challenge a 1990\r\nMassachusetts conviction, filed the instant pro se petition on\r\nFebruary 12, 1998 (or possibly some days earlier).  Even with\r\nthe grace period included, see, e.g., Gaskins v. Duval,    \r\nF.3d    , 1999 WL 447129 (1st Cir. July 7, 1999), and even with\r\nthe period during which state remedies were being pursued\r\nexcluded, see 28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(2), his petition was late. \r\nRespondent filed a motion to dismiss on this basis.  By way of\r\nopposition, petitioner explained as follows: that he had been\r\nconfined since 1994 in the \"department disciplinary unit\" (DDU)\r\nat MCI-Cedar Junction; that the main prison library did not\r\n\"start sending\" a copy of AEDPA to DDU inmates until \"late\r\n1997\" and that he did not learn thereof until early 1998; that\r\nhe otherwise lacked access to \"almost all important\r\ninformation\" regarding the Act, as well as to updated legal\r\nmaterials or any form of legal assistance; and that he would\r\nhave filed a timely petition had he known of the one-year\r\nrequirement.  For these reasons, he sought to invoke the\r\nstatutory provision that tolls the running of the limitations\r\nperiod until\r\n                    the date on which the impediment to filing\r\n          an application created by State action in\r\n          violation of the Constitution or laws of\r\n          the United States is removed, if the\r\n          applicant was prevented from filing by\r\n          such State action.\r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(1)(B).  Petitioner's factual assertions\r\nhave not been contested.\r\n          The district court construed these allegations as\r\nsetting forth a predicate claim of denial of the right of\r\naccess to the courts, in violation of Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S.\r\n343 (1996), and Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977).  It then\r\nconcluded that no viable such claim had been presented, such\r\nthat  2244(d)(1)(B) was inapplicable.  The court emphasized\r\ntwo factors in this regard.  It found that petitioner had not\r\n\"diligently pursued his federal claims,\" noting in particular\r\nthat two extended periods of time had elapsed (of nearly 29 and\r\n13 months, respectively) when no state court proceeding was\r\npending.  See 14 F. Supp. 2d at 166.  And it determined that\r\nany deficiencies in the library system had not \"prevented\"\r\npetitioner from pursuing those claims.  In this regard, it\r\nnoted, inter alia, that the federal claims were identical to\r\nthose raised earlier in state court, and that petitioner had\r\ninitiated or pursued other court actions during the relevant\r\nperiod.  See id. at 166-67. \r\n          This structure of analysis raises questions.  First,\r\nif petitioner's improbable allegations are accepted as true and\r\nwe assume that he had no reasonable means of learning of the\r\nlimitations period in timely fashion, was he thereby\r\n\"prevented\" from filing his petition within the meaning of \r\n2244(d)(1)(B)?  Cf. Lewis, 518 U.S. at 351 (explaining that a\r\nright-of-access claim might be established by showing \"that a\r\ncomplaint ... was dismissed for failure to satisfy some\r\ntechnical requirement which, because of deficiencies in the\r\nprison's legal assistance facilities, [the inmate] could not\r\nhave known\"); Fisher v. Johnson, 174 F.3d 710, 715 (5th Cir.\r\n1999) (\"[i]n the right circumstances, a delay in receiving\r\ninformation might call for equitable tolling--such as if the\r\nprison did not obtain copies of AEDPA for months and months\"). \r\nSecond, must a petitioner act with \"due diligence\" in order to\r\ninvoke  2244(d)(1)(B) (as suggested in Miller v. Marr, 141\r\nF.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 210 (1998)),\r\nor alternatively to state a claim under Lewis (as suggested by\r\nthe district court)?  Cf. Miller v. New Jersey State Dep't of\r\nCorrections, 145 F.3d 616, 618-19 (3d Cir. 1998) (requiring\r\ndiligence in order to invoke equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \r\n2244(d)(1)(D) (setting forth explicit diligence requirement).\r\n          Resolving these questions is not necessary here\r\nbecause petitioner's three substantive claims prove to be\r\nfrivolous.  His central claim is that a provision in his plea\r\nagreement--that he receive treatment as a sexual offender at\r\nBridgewater State Hospital--was never honored, thereby\r\nrendering his guilty plea invalid.  See, e.g., Santobello v.\r\nUnited States, 404 U.S. 257 (1971).  Petitioner states that all\r\npertinent facts \"appear on the face of the plea hearing\r\ntranscript.\"  Brief at 27.  Yet that transcript, a copy of\r\nwhich he has supplied to this court, makes it clear that this\r\nclaim fails for at least three reasons.  First, the stipulation\r\nin question provided--not that petitioner would receive such\r\ntreatment--but that the court would so recommend.  Second, the\r\ncourt subsequently did just that.  Most important, this\r\nstipulation was not part of the plea agreement, but was reached\r\nonly after the plea had been accepted.  The fact that\r\npetitioner apparently ended up not receiving treatment thus\r\nprovides no basis for challenging his plea.  \r\n          Petitioner also complains that he is innocent of the\r\ncrimes and that his trial attorney should have engaged a DNA\r\nexpert.  Yet the scattered findings on which he relies from\r\ncertain serology reports are of no consequence, particularly in\r\nlight of the factual proffer articulated by the government (and\r\naccepted by petitioner) at the change-of-plea hearing.  These\r\nclaims, even apart from the procedural hurdles they face, see,\r\ne.g., United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 569-74 (1989),\r\nprove utterly baseless. \r\n          We therefore choose to affirm on the basis that the\r\npetition is substantively meritless.  To the extent that the\r\ngrant of the COA might be thought to confine our review to the\r\nlimitations issue, we would add the following.  A right-of-\r\naccess challenge requires a showing that a \"nonfrivolous\" legal\r\nclaim has been frustrated or impeded.  Lewis, 518 U.S. at 353. \r\nPetitioner, having failed to present a nonfrivolous claim,\r\ncannot make such a showing.  For that reason,  2244(d)(1)(B)\r\nis inapplicable, which in turn means that his petition was also\r\nproperly dismissed on limitations grounds. \r\n          Affirmed.\n",
