  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 99-1276\r\n\nFREDERIC W. BERTHOFF,\r\n\nPetitioner, Appellant,\r\n\n          v.\r\n\n    UNITED STATES,\r\n\nRespondent, Appellee.\r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n[Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n        Before\r\n\nStahl, Circuit Judge,\r\nLipez, Circuit Judge, \r\nand Saris,* District Judge.\r\n\nMichael Bourbeau for appellant.\r\nKevin O'Regan, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 22, 1999\r\n\n\n* Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation  Per curiam.  Our review of the transcript referenced in\r\nthe certificate of appealability issued by the district court has\r\nleft us in some doubt as to the precise issue(s) on which the\r\ncertificate was granted.  The thrust of the court's remarks in\r\nissuing the certificate suggests a desire for additional guidance\r\non the constitutionality of the vastly different treatment the\r\nUnited States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts apparently\r\naccords defendants who plead and defendants who go to trial.  See\r\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135, 150-53 (1st Cir. 1998),\r\ncert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 2034 (1999).  Yet the parties have\r\nproceeded on the understanding that the court actually granted the\r\ncertificate as to whether Attorney McMenimen provided\r\nconstitutionally adequate representation to petitioner despite his\r\nadmitted failure to advise petitioner of: (1) the provision of the\r\nSeptember 23, 1993 letter from AUSA Pucci to Attorney McMenimen\r\nwhich might be read to have set forth a plea offer; and (2) the\r\nthree-level offense level reduction available under the sentencing\r\nguidelines in the event of a timely plea and acceptance of\r\nresponsibility.  See U.S.S.G.  3E1.1.  But even if we were to\r\nfollow the parties' lead, we remain insufficiently certain as to\r\nthe basis for the court's Sixth Amendment ruling to proceed to the\r\nmerits at this time.   \r\nUnder Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984),\r\na person claiming inadequate assistance of counsel must establish\r\n(1) a constitutionally deficient performance; and (2) prejudice. \r\nHere, the district court sent somewhat different signals as to the\r\nprong(s) of the Strickland test petitioner failed to satisfy.  On\r\nthe one hand, the court appears to have determined that petitioner\r\nsuffered no prejudice because he proceeded to trial with full\r\nknowledge \"that things would most assuredly go easier with him were\r\nhe to plead guilty.\"  December 9, 1998 Transcript (\"Transcript\") at\r\n14.  Broadly construed, this conclusion may be taken to encompass\r\na finding that petitioner would not have pleaded guilty even had he\r\nbeen advised of AUSA Pucci's putative plea offer and/or U.S.S.G. \r\n3E1.1 prior to trial.  But if this were the court's intent, we have\r\nsome difficulty seeing how this appeal meets the appealability\r\ncriteria specified in 28 U.S.C.  2253(c)(2).\r\nOn the other hand, the district court also characterized\r\npetitioner's representation as \"at all times constitutionally\r\nadequate.\" Transcript at 13.  This statement might be taken as a\r\ndetermination that Attorney McMenimen's pretrial performance was\r\nacceptable under Strickland's first prong.  But if this were the\r\ncourt's intent, our review would be complicated by, among other\r\nthings, the absence of subsidiary findings or rulings explaining\r\nwhy Attorney McMenimen's failure to pass along the full contents of\r\nAUSA Pucci's letter was permissible under the Sixth Amendment.  See\r\nUnited States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F.2d 747, 752-53 (1st Cir.\r\n1991) (failure to pass along a plea offer is presumptively\r\ndeficient performance under Strickland); cf. also Boria v. Keene,\r\n99 F.3d 492, 496-97 (2d Cir. 1996) (failure to discuss with a\r\nclient the advisability of accepting or rejecting a plea bargain\r\ndeprived the client of effective assistance of counsel).\r\nUnder the circumstances, we think that the prudent course\r\nis to vacate and remand for clarification.  Following remand, the\r\ndistrict court need not reissue the certificate.  But if the court\r\nchooses to do so, we urge it to specify the question on which it\r\nbelieves a certificate of appealability should issue.  If the court\r\ncertifies the ineffective assistance issue, it would facilitate our\r\nreview were the court also to address:  (1) whether petitioner\r\nwould have pleaded guilty had he received advice regarding the\r\neffect of U.S.S.G.  3E1.1 and/or notification of the full contents\r\nof AUSA Pucci's letter; (2) whether and to what extent the court\r\nwould have awarded an acceptance of responsibility reduction in the\r\nevent of a timely guilty plea in this case; (3) whether AUSA\r\nPucci's letter to Attorney McMenimen constituted a plea offer\r\nwithin the meaning of Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F.2d at 752; (4) why\r\nthe failure to pass along the contents of AUSA Pucci's letter was\r\nor was not deficient under Strickland's first prong; and (5) why\r\nthe failure to advise petitioner regarding the effect of U.S.S.G.\r\n3E1.1 was or was not deficient under Strickland's first prong. \r\nVacated and remanded.\n",
