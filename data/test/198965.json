Ably represented, plaintiff-\n\nappellant Elaine Chandler challenges a fiduciary's determination\n\ndeeming her ineligible to receive long-term disability benefits\n\nunder a plan sponsored by her employer, Raytheon Company.              The\n\nplan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\n\nof 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461.\n\n           The denial of benefits occurred when the plan's claims\n\nadministrator, defendant-appellee Metropolitan Life Insurance\n\nCompany (Met Life), determined that, as of the critical date\n\n(July 1995), Chandler was not \"totally disabled\" as that term is\n\ndefined in the plan.         Chandler exhausted her administrative\n\nremedies and then sought judicial review.              See 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(a)(1)(B).     The district court rejected her plea.               See\n\nChandler v. Raytheon Employees Disability Trust, 53 F. Supp. 2d\n\n84   (D.   Mass.   1999)     (granting    summary    judgment    for   the\n\ndefendants).    Chandler appeals that order.\n\n           We previously acknowledged that when a judge accurately\n\ntakes   the   measure   of   a   case   and   articulates   a   convincing\n\nrationale, \"an appellate court should refrain from writing at\n\nlength to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\"\n\nLawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); accord Cruz-Ramos v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co., 202\n\nF.3d 381, 383 (1st Cir. 2000); Ayala v.

(In re San Juan Dupont Plaza\n\nHotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).             This\n\nprinciple has particular force where, as here, a case involves\n\nno more than the application of uncontroversial legal rules to\n\na specific, highly idiosyncratic set of facts.      Thus, we affirm\n\nthe judgment below for substantially the reasons elucidated in\n\nJudge Saris's thoughtful rescript.       See 53 F. Supp. 2d at 91.\n\n            We add only that we are fully persuaded that the\n\nappropriate standard by which Met Life's decision must be gauged\n\nis whether its actions can be deemed arbitrary and capricious.\n\nSee Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115\n\n(1989); Recupero v. New Engl. Tele. & Tel. Co., 118 F.3d 820,\n\n827 (1st Cir. 1997).   Because the evidence of record here, taken\n\nas   a   whole,   affords   reasonable   support   for   Met   Life's\n\ndetermination, that rampart has not been breached.       See Doyle v.\n\nPaul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nWe need go no further.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
