      "            selya, circuit judge.           on august 13, 2008, defendant-  appellant noel dávila-gonzález entered a straight plea of guilty to  charges of (i) aiding and abetting the laundering of money derived  from unlawful activities and (ii) conspiracy to commit money  laundering.        see 18 u.s.c. §§ 2, 1956(a)(1)(b), 1956(h).              the  district court sentenced him to serve a 78-month incarcerative  term.    the appellant now challenges his sentence, citing a number  of    supposed     procedural   errors.      discerning   no   merit   in   the  appellant's claims, we affirm.              when a sentencing appeal follows a guilty plea, \"we glean  the     relevant    facts   from    the     change-of-plea     colloquy,    the  unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report (psi  report), and the record of the disposition hearing.\" united states  v. vargas, 560 f.3d 45, 47 (1st cir. 2009).               in following this  praxis, we rehearse only those facts that are needed to put the  claims of error into context.              on october 15, 2004, the appellant called a known member  of a drug cartel to arrange for the delivery of \"two bundles.\"  unfortunately for the appellant, the person to whom he reached out  doubled in brass as a confidential informant for the federal bureau  of investigation (fbi).         over the course of several calls, most of  which were recorded, the appellant and the informant agreed to meet  and consummate the transaction.                                           -2- \f",
      "              this meeting took place at a burger king restaurant in  puerto rico on october 18, 2004.                        at that time the appellant  effected      delivery       of    the    \"two      bundles\"      to    the       informant.  subsequent analysis revealed that the \"two bundles\" contained  $204,440 in united states currency.                rather than springing the trap then and there, the fbi  continued its investigation for nearly three years.                               on may 3,  2007, a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico  returned a six-count indictment against the appellant and others.  the authorities arrested the appellant in tampa, florida, on may 9,  2008.      following his rendition to puerto rico, the appellant  entered a plea of guilty to the three counts against him (one of  which was dismissed at sentencing).                the district court convened the disposition hearing on  november    13,    2008.          the   court    deemed      applicable       a   six-level  sentencing enhancement after finding that \"the defendant knew or  believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or  were    intended        to   promote     .   .     .    an   offense     involving      the  manufacture, importation, or distribution of a controlled substance  or a listed chemical.\"              ussg §2s1.1(b)(1)(b)(i).                 it also ruled  that,   for    sentencing         purposes,        it    would   hold    the      appellant  responsible       for    only     the    cash    contained       in    the    two   bundles  ($204,440), even though the conspiracy as a whole had laundered a  much greater sum (approximately $1,839,208).                                                -3- \f",
      "            the court then proceeded to deny the appellant's request  for a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment.             see ussg §3b1.2(b)  (authorizing a two-level downward adjustment if the defendant  played a minor role in the offense).             making a series of other  calculations, the court settled upon a total offense level of 25  and a criminal history category of iii.                 in this venue, the  appellant does not challenge any of these rulings but, rather,  accepts    the   district    court's     calculation     of    the      guideline  sentencing range (gsr): 70-87 months.              during   the    sentencing      proceedings,      defense    counsel  briefly mentioned that the appellant was a former heroin addict  who, since committing the offense of conviction, had rehabilitated  himself.    this information led to the following exchange:              the court: so what are you suggesting?              defense counsel: i'm suggesting that the court             depart downward because this . . .              the court: absolutely not.          on the basis of             what?  to this question, defense counsel explicated, in some detail, that  during the years intervening between the offense conduct and the  arrest, the appellant had checked himself into a rehabilitation  facility, moved to florida, forsook his criminal ways, and obtained  gainful    employment.      counsel    argued    that   these    developments  suggested that a below-the-range sentence would be an appropriate  outcome.    the district court disagreed, stating:                                         -4- \f",
      "            i'm going to deny the role request that you're             making.    i am going to deny the departure             request you're going to make, and i'm going to             deny any other sentence than the advisory             guideline proposed here.                     there is nothing on this record under             3553(a) that moves me, moves me to consider             any other sentence than the sentence proposed             as advisory by the guidelines for cases like             this.              in the end, the court imposed a mid-range sentence of 78  months in prison.        at the conclusion of the hearing, it asked  whether either side had \"[a]nything else?\"            the only rejoinder was  from defense counsel, who requested that the sentence be served in  \"the tampa area.\"              in this appeal, the appellant argues that the sentencing  court     committed     reversible     error    by     (i)   presuming    the  reasonableness of the gsr; (ii) neglecting sufficiently to explain  the sentence imposed; and (iii) failing to consider mitigating  factors favoring a below-the-range sentence.              we approach these  claims of error mindful that, in the wake of the supreme court's  landmark decision in united states v. booker, 543 u.s. 220, 245  (2005),    we   have   encouraged    the   district    courts   to   follow   a  specifically delineated roadmap when sentencing under the now-  advisory federal sentencing guidelines:              [a] sentencing court ordinarily should begin             by   calculating  the   applicable   guideline             sentencing range; then determine whether or             not any departures are in order; then mull the             factors delineated in 18 u.s.c. § 3553(a) as             well as any other relevant considerations;             and, finally, determine what sentence, whether                                       -5- \f",
      "                within,   above,  or   below  the   guideline                 sentencing range, appears appropriate.  united states v. pelletier, 469 f.3d 194, 203 (1st cir. 2006)  (citing united states v. jiménez-beltre, 440 f.3d 514, 518-19 (1st  cir. 2006) (en banc)).                  the court below did not follow this roadmap.                     that  omission complicates appellate review, but in this instance it does  not frustrate that review. after all, we have treated this roadmap  as helpful, but not obligatory. thus, a sentencing court may leave  the roadmap to one side and proceed in some other sequence as long  as   the   findings      are   made    and   all    the   requisite    factors    are  addressed.        see, e.g., united states v. pacheco, 489 f.3d 40, 44  (1st cir. 2007) (explaining that district court may combine steps  or vary the order).        this is such a case.                  in reviewing a sentence, we seek to ensure that it is  both procedurally sound and substantively reasonable.                        united  states     v.    martin,   520   f.3d    87,   92    (1st    cir.   2008).   here,  substantive reasonableness is not in issue; the appellant assigns  only   procedural       error.        that   taxonomy       includes   \"failing    to  calculate        (or   improperly     calculating)        the   guidelines   range,  treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18  u.s.c. § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly  erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen  sentence.\"       united states v. stone, 575 f.3d 83, 89 (1st cir. 2009)                                             -6- \f",
      "(quoting united states v. innarelli, 524 f.3d 286, 292 (1st cir.  2008)).             the appellant's claims of error, like all claims of  procedural unreasonableness in sentencing, are reviewed, generally,  for abuse of discretion.    united states v. carrasco-de-jesús, 589  f.3d 22, 26-27 (1st cir. 2009); martin, 520 f.3d at 92.             yet, when  a defendant fails to preserve an objection below, the plain error  standard supplants the customary standard of review.               see, e.g.,  united states v. almenas, 553 f.3d 27, 36 (1st cir. 2009); united  states v. mangual-garcia, 505 f.3d 1, 15 (1st cir. 2007).             in the case at hand, the appellant did not interpose an  objection as to any of the procedures that he now seeks to  challenge.   this default is particularly glaring in view of the  district   court's   specific   inquiry      at    the   conclusion   of   the  disposition hearing.     consequently, plain error review obtains.  \"review for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error  occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)  affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously  impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial  proceedings.\"   united states v. duarte, 246 f.3d 56, 60 (1st cir.  2001).             against   this   backdrop    we        proceed   to   address   the  appellant's claims of error one by one.                                       -7- \f",
      "            the first issue deals with the weight that the district  court attached to the gsr.       the touchstone for our analysis is the  decision in gall v. united states, 552 u.s. 38 (2007).           there, the  supreme court admonished that even though the federal sentencing  guidelines \"should be the starting point and the initial benchmark\"  for constructing a sentence, the sentencing court \"may not presume  that the guidelines range is reasonable.\"          id. at 49-50.              citing the court's follow-on decision in nelson v. united  states, 129 s. ct. 890 (2009) (per curiam), the appellant labors to  convince us that the court below transgressed this tenet.                in  particular, he assails the court's statement that it was \"going to  deny any other sentence than the advisory guideline proposed\" and  its summary rejection of his entreaty to depart downward.            in the  appellant's view, these actions demonstrate the sentencing court's  embrace    of   the   very   presumption   of   reasonableness   that   gall  forbids.              we find this argument unpersuasive.         to begin, nelson  does not assist the appellant's cause.          there, the district court  unequivocally declared at sentencing that \"the guidelines are  considered presumptively reasonable.\"           id. at 891.      that was a  patent violation of the tenet articulated in gall.              the case at bar is at a considerable remove.           here, the  sentencing court made no such declaration. although it declined to  accept the appellant's proposal for a non-guideline sentence (24                                        -8- \f",
      "months), it made that ruling only after hearing lengthy arguments  as to whether and why the gsr should hold sway.                           the court  concluded that there was \"nothing on th[e] record\" that prompted it  \"to consider any other sentence than the sentence proposed as  advisory by the guidelines.\"                 there is a world of difference between according a  presumption of reasonableness to the gsr — a practice that gall  forbids    —    and    finding    that   the     gsr,   in    a    particular    case,  represents an appropriate sentencing range.                  this is a case of the  latter stripe.                 read as a whole, the sentencing transcript makes manifest  not only the court's awareness that the gsr was merely an initial  benchmark, but also its conclusion that the circumstances of the  case made it appropriate to hew to that benchmark in fashioning the  appellant's sentence.            that was not error.              see, e.g., united  states v. smith, 531 f.3d 109, 112 (1st cir. 2008) (finding no  presumption of reasonableness where the district court \"did not  feel bound to impose a sentence within the gsr\").                 the appellant's next contention is that the district  court failed adequately to explain its rationale for the sentence  it imposed.        in this regard, the appellant invokes a statute  providing that, in a federal criminal case, a sentencing court must  \"state    in    open   court     the   reasons    for   its       imposition    of   the  particular sentence.\"          18 u.s.c. § 3553(c).                                            -9- \f",
      "                 we have recognized, however, that this directive must be  read in a practical, common-sense way.                    the statutory directive  \"does not mean that the sentencing court's explanation need be  precise to the point of pedantry.\"                     united states v. turbides-  leonardo, 468 f.3d 34, 40 (1st cir. 2006).                    in all events, \"with  respect to a sentencing court's duty of explanation, brevity is not  to    be    confused    with     inattention.\"          id.   at   41-42.     this   is  especially true where, as here, a court prescribes a sentence that  falls within the gsr.             see id. at 41; see also rita v. united  states, 551 u.s. 338, 356-57 (2007) (\"[w]hen a judge decides simply  to apply the guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not  necessarily require lengthy explanation.\").                    where, as here, the  gsr has been correctly calculated and spans less than 24 months  from bottom to top, a district court \"arguably is not required to  cite       any   reasons   for    imposing       a    within-the-range      sentence.\"  turbides-leonardo, 468 f.3d at 41 (emphasis in original).                   these principles are dispositive here.              although it is  true that the district court did not explicitly address each of the  appellant's arguments for a below-the-range sentence, the court was  not required to offer that level of elucidation.                   see id. at 40-41.  a    sentencing      court's     process    of       ratiocination   \"can    often   be  inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained  in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\"                         jiménez-  beltre, 440 f.3d at 519; see also rita, 551 u.s. at 358 (holding                                              -10- \f",
      "that where the sentencing court imposed a within-the-range sentence  and the record indicates that the court heard the defendant's  arguments   and    considered   the    supporting      evidence,   it   may   be  inferred    that   \"[t]he   judge     simply   found    the[]   circumstances  insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the guidelines  range\").              so it is here: we may infer from the protracted arguments  and colloquy preceding the imposition of sentence that the court  below considered all the arguments and evidence before settling  upon an appropriate sentence. the court's clear pronouncement that  there was nothing in the record that warranted unusually favorable  treatment bolsters this inference.              as a subset of this argument, the appellant suggests that  18 u.s.c. § 3553(c)(1) required more specificity. that suggestion,  however, is grounded in a misreading of the statute.1                     this  provision applies only when the span of the gsr, measured from the  low end to the high end, is greater than 24 months.                see united  states v. arango, 508 f.3d 34, 44 (1st cir. 2007); united states v.  cirilo-muñoz, 504 f.3d 106, 131 (1st cir. 2007) (per curiam).  here, the sentencing range begins at 70 months and tops off at 87  months. simple arithmetic demonstrates that the spread between the         1        18 u.s.c. § 3553(c) provides in pertinent part that if the gsr \"exceeds 24 months,\" the court \"shall state in open court . . . the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\"                                        -11- \f",

      "               howard, circuit judge. following a three-day jury trial,  defendant darryl dowdell was convicted of distribution of cocaine  base     and    sentenced       as   a   career     offender   to    198    months'  imprisonment.           dowdell appeals the conviction, alleging three  defects:         that    the    delay    between    his    indictment      by   state  authorities and his ultimate trial in federal court violated his  sixth amendment speedy trial rights as well as the interstate  agreement on detainers; that the district court's amendment of the  indictment       from     \"cocaine\"      to     \"cocaine   base\"    violated      the  presentment clause of the fifth amendment; and that the trial court  abused its discretion on various evidentiary rulings.                       he also  challenges the sentence imposed, arguing that the government's  recommended sentence of 262 months violated a promise not to seek  a term of imprisonment longer than 20 years.                for the reasons that  follow, we affirm both the conviction and the sentence.  i. background and travel                 while the facts surrounding the underlying offense are  not complicated, the pre-trial procedural history of this case  presents a maze of overlapping federal and state activity, a flurry  of continuances, and a revolving door of withdrawn and newly  appointed defense counsel.                                 a. the subject offense                 the following facts were elicited at dowdell's federal  trial.                                             -2- \f",
      "           in the summer of 2001, several massachusetts authorities  launched a coordinated effort with the federal drug enforcement  administration (dea) to investigate drug trafficking in the area of  a housing project in roxbury.           the investigation involved a task  force of undercover officers who made controlled purchases of  cocaine and crack cocaine from dealers operating in the project.  one of these officers was boston housing authority investigator  joao monteiro.   posing as a construction worker, monteiro drove an  unmarked car with a concealed audio transmitter and a video camera  that focused on the automobile's interior passenger compartment.             on july 6, 2001, monteiro observed dowdell standing on  the   sidewalk   with    a   man     named   robert   white,    whom    monteiro  recognized from previous encounters.              dowdell was wearing dark  pants and a black shirt.              he and white were counting cash.  monteiro   signaled     to   white    that   he   wished   to   purchase   crack  cocaine, and white went to talk to dowdell.            white then approached  monteiro's car and got into the passenger seat.                     white told  monteiro that dowdell, at this point identified only as \"the dark-  skinned brother\" in the dark shirt, was a trustworthy dealer.  after purchasing 1.1 grams of crack cocaine for $230, monteiro  asked white whether \"the dude in black\" was the person to see for  future   purchases    if     white    were   unavailable.       white   replied  affirmatively and informed monteiro that dowdell went by the name                                            -3- \f",
      "\"smoke.\" monteiro departed, after informing white that he would be  returning in a short while to make another purchase.              some 45 minutes later, monteiro returned to the project  and saw dowdell on a bicycle.     monteiro approached dowdell, who  asked monteiro if he wanted anything.    monteiro responded that he  was looking for white, and dowdell then biked over to the spot  where white was standing.   white came over to monteiro's car and,  for the second time that night, sat down beside monteiro in the  passenger seat.    monteiro told white that he wished to purchase  more drugs, as well as baggies for repackaging.   white agreed and,  after directing monteiro to a parking area close to the spot of the  first transaction, sold him 1.2 grams of crack cocaine and baggies  for $210.              monteiro returned for a third buy on july 16, ten days  after the first two.   when he arrived, he saw dowdell standing in  a small group, wearing blue jeans and a blue checkered shirt.  monteiro again asked for white, who was unavailable.       monteiro  asked for directions and drove away, making it appear that he was  going off to search for white.    after waiting long enough to give  the impression that the search was unsuccessful, he returned to the  project looking for dowdell.     he found dowdell on the sidewalk,  still wearing a blue checkered shirt.     monteiro called out \"yo,  smoke, can i holler at you.\"     dowdell approached monteiro's car,  and the two of them proceeded to have a conversation through the                                    -4- \f",
      "passenger-side window.     continuing to address dowdell as \"smoke,\"  monteiro asked for about $200 worth of crack cocaine. dowdell left  briefly to meet with another individual and then returned with six  bags of crack cocaine, worth approximately $100.    seven more bags  would eventually follow. the total weight of the thirteen bags was  approximately 2.3 grams.    during this whole encounter, dowdell was  only partially visible on the video that monteiro's surveillance  camera recorded.            driving away, monteiro narrated a description of dowdell  for the surveillance recording.    he stated, \"smoke is the same kid  as the last time.. [sic] he's got on a checkered shirt blue...blue  checkered shirt umm and he was riding a bicycle.\"            later that day, dowdell was arrested on an outstanding  warrant unrelated to his transactions with monteiro.         he was  brought to a boston police station where a booking photo was taken.  in the photo, dowdell was wearing a blue checkered shirt, as  monteiro had described earlier in the day.       later, around four  hours after completing the buy from dowdell, monteiro was shown the  photograph and identified the depicted individual as \"smoke.\"  monteiro reported that the individual in the photograph was the  same person from whom he had purchased drugs that day and whom he  had seen standing on the corner with white ten days beforehand.                                       -5- \f",
      "                   b. pre-trial procedural history              because the timing of particular pre-trial events is  important to our legal analysis, we must delve into some detail in  retracing the path on which this case traveled before it reached  the jury.              on march 25, 2002, eight months after the july 2001  encounters at the housing project, a suffolk county grand jury  indicted    dowdell,    based   on   those   events,     for       distributing    a  controlled substance in the vicinity of school property.                     at his  arraignment, he pled not guilty and was released on bail, which was  subsequently   revoked    in    october     2003   due   to    a    charge   on   an  unrelated crime.       on april 12, 2004, dowdell's appointed counsel  withdrew his representation and was replaced.                  that replacement  would in turn withdraw in august of that year, and the court  appointed a third attorney.              on november 17, 2004, the federal government filed a  criminal complaint against dowdell based on the july 2001 events,  charging him with distribution of crack cocaine in violation of 21  u.s.c. § 841(a)(1).      at that time, dowdell was already serving a  27-month sentence in the suffolk county house of correction after  a conviction on the unrelated charge that had triggered his bail  revocation.    one month later, in december 2004, the commonwealth  entered a nolle prosequi on the march 25, 2002 indictment for  distributing a controlled substance in the vicinity of school                                          -6- \f",
      "property,    effectively    terminating        its     prosecution.     dowdell  remained in state custody as he continued to serve his ongoing  sentence on the unrelated charge, but from this point onward he  faced only the federal distribution charge.              on february 4, 2005, then unrepresented by counsel,  dowdell   wrote   a   letter   to   a    clerk   for    the   magistrate   judge  overseeing the pre-trial proceedings in his federal case.                   the  letter invoked his speedy trial rights under 18 u.s.c. § 3161.  nearly three weeks later, dowdell followed this letter with a  formal request under the interstate agreement on detainers (iad),  18 u.s.c. app. 2, § 2, that he be transferred from state to federal  custody as he awaited the resolution of the federal charge.                  on  march 14, 2005, the federal government petitioned for a writ of  habeas corpus ad prosequendum, and on march 22, 2005, dowdell was  brought into federal district court for his initial appearance, at  which point he was assigned new representation.              during    the      initial        appearance,     the     prosecutor  acknowledged that dowdell's transfer into federal custody was  pursuant to a writ \"based on the defendant's request under the  interstate agreement on detainers.\"            he proceeded to explain that  dowdell had no intention of waiving his iad rights, which dowdell's  counsel confirmed. by preserving his rights under the iad, dowdell  was to remain in federal custody and receive credit toward the  fulfillment of his term of incarceration for the unrelated charge                                            -7- \f",

      "directly and instrinsically relevant to the charge against mr.  dowdell in this case.\"        as for the hearsay claim, the district  court adopted both of the government's theories of admissibility.             during the course of the pre-trial conference, dowdell  argued that even if a transcript of the statements would be  admissible, the videotape itself would be unfairly prejudicial.  the government insisted that it was entitled to use the video to  prove its case, as only the video showed what sort of opportunity  monteiro had to actually see dowdell from the car.              again, the  district   court   rejected   dowdell's   argument,   finding    that   the  videotape was the best evidence.      though ordering two minor edits  to the video and the corresponding transcript,5 the court ruled  that the videotaped statements were otherwise admissible in their  original form.                                e. sentencing             on may 31, 2007, after three days of trial, the jury  returned a guilty verdict.             under § 841(b)(1)(c), dowdell would normally have faced  a maximum sentence of 20 years.      mention of this 20-year maximum  had arisen earlier in the pre-trial proceedings, when dowdell had  challenged   the   government's   attempt   to   amend   the   indictment.  dowdell had initially claimed that the change in drug type was       5       the two edits were (1) changing the defendant's name in the transcript from \"dowdell\" to \"smoke\" and (2) deleting a statement by white that dowdell was his \"cousin.\"                                    -19- \f",
      "material because it might increase the sentence length to which he  would be exposed.    the government had responded that because drug  type was not an element in this case, the maximum would remain at  20 years regardless.        in making this point, the government had  stated in writing that it was \"not seeking (and cannot seek) a  sentence in excess of 20 years.\"             the district court cited this  language in allowing the amendment.              nevertheless, in april 2007, the government filed an  information to establish a prior conviction under 21 u.s.c. § 851,  which increased the statutory maximum from 20 to 30 years (and the  guideline   range   from    210–262    months    to   262–327   months).   at  sentencing, the government recommended a 262-month sentence, at the  bottom end of the guideline range but well over the original 20-  year statutory maximum.       the court ultimately sentenced dowdell to  198 months, followed by six years' supervised release. dowdell did  not object to the sentence.  ii. discussion                             a. speedy trial rights              dowdell first contends that the district court erred in  denying his motion to dismiss on constitutional speedy trial  grounds. the district court noted, but never resolved, whether the  appropriate starting point for the speedy trial clock was the  federal or the state indictment.               because it determined that  \"dowdell ha[d] failed to demonstrate prejudice which rises to the                                         -20- \f",

      "challenge    any   length   of   time   that     elapsed    after   this   date.7  instead, he focuses on the time frame preceding it, arguing that  his speedy trial rights in fact accrued with his state indictment  on   march   25,   2002.    were   that    the    case,    it    would   yield   a  presumptively prejudicial delay of nearly three years before the  federal indictment was returned.               addressing this argument requires us to consider the  speedy trial implications of the dual sovereignty doctrine.                under  this doctrine, \"the federal government is not bound by the actions  of state authorities and . . . successive state and federal  prosecutions are constitutionally permissible.\"                 united states v.  mejias, 552 f.2d 435, 441–42 (2d cir. 1977).               though perhaps most  recognizable from the double jeopardy context, see, e.g., abbate v.  united states, 359 u.s. 187 (1959), dual sovereignty considerations  animate our constitutional speedy trial jurisprudence, as well. in  macdonald, the supreme court briefly noted that \"an arrest or  indictment by one sovereign would not cause the speedy trial  guarantees to become engaged as to possible subsequent indictments  by another sovereign.\" 456 u.s. at 10 n.11.           following macdonald's  lead, we observed in united states v. marler, 756 f.2d 206 (1st  cir. 1985), that \"a ruling that a defendant's right to a speedy         7       he would, of course, have been entirely free to do so, as his speedy trial rights remained in effect up until his trial date, united states v. jenkins-watts, 574 f.3d 950, 966 (8th cir. 2009), which was not until may 2007. nevertheless, because dowdell waived the claim with respect to this period, we do not address it.                                      -24- \f",
      "federal trial attaches upon his state indictment would implicate  the   very   concerns   that   led   the    court   to   formulate   the   dual  sovereignty doctrine in the double jeopardy area.\"            id. at 211.   we  further elaborated the policy arguments that bolster the case for  a robust dual sovereignty doctrine in the speedy trial context:               were we to hold that marler's state court              indictment triggered his speedy trial right,              we would in effect be requiring the federal              government to keep continually abreast of all              state criminal investigations that may present              the possibility of federal prosecution and to              pursue their own investigations, arrests,              indictments, and trials so as to conform with              state-dictated timing.     this is obviously              counter to the dual sovereignty doctrine as              well   as  to   effective,   responsible   law              enforcement. . . . thus, whatever the              weaknesses in our dual system of justice,              these could only be exacerbated by the              proposed expansion of the sixth amendment              speedy trial right.  id.               dowdell does not contest the truth of any of this as a  general matter, but he nevertheless insists that his case falls  within a recognized exception.         he principally relies on united  states v. cabral, 475 f.2d 715 (1st cir. 1973).             in cabral, state  police officers investigating the defendant for sale of stolen  property arrested him for possessing a sawed-off shotgun.                   the  state turned the weapon over to federal authorities three days  after the arrest.       cabral was indicted in state court for the  stolen property offense and then, fifteen months later, in federal  court for the weapons offense.             in considering cabral's speedy                                        -25- \f",
      "trial claim, we held that his constitutional right \"crystallized at  the time of his initial [state] arrest\" because it was for the same  offense as his ultimate federal indictment, and \"[t]he [federal]  government's prosecution of this charge was initiated only three  days later when . . . state authorities turned over this weapon to  a federal officer.\"    id. at 718.    thus, dowdell argues, cabral  instructs us to attribute a state-court indictment to the federal  government where a subsequent federal indictment was essentially a  continuation of the state proceedings.   because his state charges  arose out of a federal investigation, were for the same offense as  his federal charges, and were allegedly dismissed following a  coordinated effort with the federal government, dowdell would have  us apply this cabral exception in our speedy trial analysis here.            cabral, however, predates the supreme court's development  of the dual sovereignty doctrine in macdonald.     for this reason,  the marler court questioned, although it did not decide, whether  cabral remained good law.   756 f.2d at 212.   other courts have not  been so hesitant.     see, e.g., united states v. garner, 32 f.3d  1305, 1309 (8th cir. 1994) (rejecting cabral's rationale and  finding it \"in conflict with subsequent statements made by the  supreme court\"); united states v. collamore, 751 f. supp. 1012,  1025 n.13 (d. me. 1990) (recognizing that marler had left the  cabral exception \"an open question\" and then definitively holding  that \"there is no such exception\").   dowdell labors to convince us                                   -26- \f",
      "of cabral's continued vitality, pointing to some courts' careful  efforts to distinguish it on the facts rather than reject it  outright.   but if cabral has managed to survive until this point,  it has only been through the force of its own obsolescence.  dowdell has not identified a single post-macdonald case from this  or any other jurisdiction to have relied on the exception he urges  us to rely on here.              a quarter-century of consistent authority impels us to  answer marler's question and hold that supreme court precedent has  abrogated cabral.8    the speed of a federal trial is measured from  the federal accusation on which it is based; one sovereign's  enforcement of its own criminal laws is not attributable to another  sovereign    merely   because   of     the   presence   of   investigatory  assistance, prosecutorial collaboration, or overlap among charges.              in his reply brief, dowdell relatedly argues that this  case falls within an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine,  established in bartkus v. illinois, 359 u.s. 121, 123–24 (1959),  for situations in which the state prosecution is \"merely a tool of  the federal authorities.\"       dowdell has waived this argument by       8       following the procedure described in cases such as crowe v. bolduc, 365 f.3d 86, 89 n.1 (1st cir. 2004) and carpenters local union no. 26 v. u.s. fid. & guar. co., 215 f.3d 136, 138 n.1 (1st cir. 2000), the proposed panel opinion in this case was circulated to all active judges of the court, a majority of whom posed no objection to our handling of cabral.     the use of this informal procedure does not convert this opinion into an opinion en banc, nor does it preclude a suggestion of rehearing en banc on any issue in the case, whether or not related to the panel's treatment of cabral.                                       -27- \f",
      "neglecting to include it in his initial brief.             see united states  v. hall, 557 f.3d 15, 20 n.3 (1st cir. 2009).                     moreover, the  argument lacks merit.       the bartkus exception is \"narrow[ly]. . . .  limited    to    situations   in   which    one   sovereign   so     thoroughly  dominates or manipulates the prosecutorial machinery of another  that   the      latter   retains   little   or    no   volition    in   its   own  proceedings.\"       united states v. guzman, 85 f.3d 823, 827 (1st cir.  1996).    to establish a prima facie case, dowdell would need to show  that \"one sovereign was a pawn of the other, with the result that  notion of two supposedly independent prosecutions is merely a  sham.\"    id.    he has not done so.    that the dea was heavily involved  in dowdell's investigation establishes little more than routine  intergovernmental assistance. \"cooperative law enforcement efforts  between independent sovereigns are commendable, and, without more,  such efforts will not furnish a legally adequate basis for invoking  the bartkus exception to the dual sovereign rule.\"                  id. at 828.  dowdell's putative smoking gun, that an assistant district attorney  exclaimed \"if you blow my case i am gonna get your drug case sent  back to the feds,\" shows, at worst, a threat.                      it does not  establish coordinated manipulation, much less that the federal  government was acting as a pawn of suffolk county officials such  that it retained little or no volition in its own proceedings.               we discern no evidence of improper collusion.              although  the bartkus exception may apply to some speedy trial cases, this is                                         -28- \f",
      "not one of them.     consequently, we conclude that dowdell's speedy  trial right attached on the date of his federal indictment.        there  was no presumptively prejudicial delay, and analysis of the other  barker factors is therefore unnecessary.                      b. interstate agreement on detainers              even if the pre-trial delay does not offend the sixth  amendment, it may still violate the iad, 18 u.s.c. app. 2, § 2.  the iad is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact designed  to   \"encourage     the   expeditious    and   orderly   disposition   of  [outstanding] charges and determination of the proper status of any  and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, and  complaints.\"    id. art. i.    to meet this goal, the iad prescribes  procedures by which a member state may obtain for trial a prisoner  incarcerated in another member jurisdiction, and by which the  prisoner may demand the speedy disposition of certain charges  pending against him in another jurisdiction.9       see united states v.  mauro, 436 u.s. 340, 343–44, 349–53 (1978) (providing background on  the iad).      the iad's provisions come into play whenever the  prosecuting authority (\"the receiving state\") files a detainer on          9       the federal government is considered a member state for purposes of the iad. united states v. henson, 945 f.2d 430, 434 (1st cir. 1991).                                    -29- \f",
      "a prisoner serving a sentence in another jurisdiction (\"the sending  state\").10               at issue here are the speedy trial provisions that the  iad imposes on the receiving state.           if the receiving state  initiates the transfer through a written request for temporary  custody, it must bring the prisoner to trial within 120 days of his  arrival in that jurisdiction.       18 u.s.c. app. 2, § 2, art. iv(c).  if, on the other hand, the prisoner initiates the transfer through  a request for final disposition, that window is 180 days from the  sending state's receipt of the request.       id. art. iii(a).   if the  receiving state fails to observe these strictures, it must dismiss  the indictment.    id. art. v(c);    united states v. bozeman, 533 u.s.  146, 153 (2001).               dowdell avers for the first time on appeal that dismissal  is necessary because the iad clock had expired before he was ever  brought to trial.11    at no point before filing his appellate brief       10       the iad only applies to prisoners against whom detainers have been filed.    neither party has confirmed or denied whether a detainer was ever actually filed against dowdell in this case, and we can find no indication in the record one way or the other. because the issue has not been contested, and because we ultimately find no reversible error, we proceed on the assumption that a detainer was filed. we stress, however, that parties litigating iad claims ought not to take the existence of a detainer for granted. see mauro, 436 u.s. at 364 n.29 (noting that \"during a typical year federal courts issue approximately 5,000 ad prosequendum writs and that about 3,000 of those are in cases in which a detainer has previously been lodged against the prisoner\").      11       both parties leave unresolved whether dowdell initiated the transfer through his pro se letter, triggering the 120-day clock, or whether the government did through its habeas petition,                                      -30- \f",

      "relies    on    mauro,   in   which    the   supreme    court    ruled    that   the  defendant's failure to invoke the iad \"in specific terms\" in his  speedy trial motions did not result in the waiver of an article  iv(c) claim.        436 u.s. at 364.            in mauro, the defendant had  \"persistently      requested\"    a     speedy   trial   and     had    \"sought   the  dismissal of his indictment on the ground that the delay in  bringing him to trial while the detainer remained lodged against  him was causing him to be denied certain privileges at the state  prison.\"       id. at 364-65.         on those bases, the court found his  actions \"sufficient to put the government and the district court on  notice of the substance of his claim.\"            id.; accord eaddy, 595 f.2d  at 346 (finding a speedy trial motion sufficient to give notice of  an iad challenge even though it \"was not framed in the precise  language of the agreement\").                 this case is distinguishable from mauro in two critical  respects. first and foremost, dowdell did not have a colorable iad  claim at the time he filed the speedy trial motion.                   even assuming  the most defendant-favorable set of circumstances, the earliest  trial deadline under the iad would have been july 20, 2005.13                    yet       13       the parties dispute several matters that would affect our calculation of the actual deadline: (1) whether dowdell initiated the transfer through his pro se letter, triggering the 120-day clock, or whether the government did through its habeas petition, triggering the 180-day clock; (2) whether 78 days of excludable time under the speedy trial act were automatically excludable under the iad; and (3) whether any portion of the government's four-month lapse in responding to dowdell's original motion to dismiss should be excludable. giving dowdell the benefit of the doubt on each, the clock would have run uninterrupted beginning with his initial                                          -33- \f",
      "dowdell filed his motion to dismiss nearly two weeks earlier, on  july 8.    thus, dowdell is in substance arguing that the district  court ought to have dismissed the indictment based on a ground that  not only was absent from the motion to dismiss, but that did not  even exist at the time the motion was filed.             the fallacy in this  position should be clear enough.            to have the issue preserved,  dowdell would not need us to infer it from his motion to dismiss so  much as to generate it ex nihilo at some later point.                  this we  cannot do.             second,      neither   dowdell's     motion   nor   any   subsequent  communication said anything about the negative effects that the  outstanding detainer might be having on his rehabilitation.                   we  think   that   element    critical   to   the    court's   holding    in    mauro  because, as the court stressed, it was the attempt to ameliorate  precisely those effects that prompted the iad's passage.               see 436  u.s. at 359–60.        we do not read mauro to mean that every speedy  trial claim filed by a detainee necessarily contains an embedded  iad claim.     the court was not propounding free association as an  interpretive canon.       it was, rather, placing weight on the precise  identity     between    the   defendant's     alleged    prejudice    and    the  prejudice that the iad targets. because dowdell's motion never  represented that the requested relief would redound to the success  of his rehabilitation, we do not consider it \"sufficient to put the   appearance on march 22, 2005, yielding a latest acceptable trial date of july 20, 2005.                                       -34- \f",

      "1991); cf. united states v. staula, 80 f.3d 596, 601 (1st cir.  1996) (holding in the speedy trial act context that courts may  exclude the time between the filing of the motion and the hearing  on that motion, even if the delay is overlong, inexplicable, or  unreasonable).       although dowdell does not address any period of  time after the court decided his motion in july 2006, we note that  the ensuing ten months of delay were entirely due to his requests  for continuances and change of counsel. as a result, dowdell's iad  claim fails.                        c. amendment of the indictment             dowdell         next      challenges     the      district     court's  modification of the indictment to reflect distribution of \"cocaine  base\" rather than \"cocaine.\"            according to dowdell, this change  constituted a material amendment that deprived him of his right to  presentment of charges to a grand jury.                   as we have explained  above,   the   district      court    treated     the    proposed   change   as   a  ministerial correction to a clerical error.                 our review of this  issue is de novo.     united states v. hernandez, 490 f.3d 81, 83 (1st  cir. 2007).     before we undertake that review, however, a bit of  terminological housecleaning is in order.             the district court appears to have viewed its task as  explaining     why   the    proposed     change    was    not   a   \"constructive  amendment.\" this approach treats the word 'constructive' as a term  of art for 'impermissible.'            that synonymic treatment may not be                                            -36- \f",
      "quite right, however.             a constructive amendment, as the name  suggests, is constructive, that is, having effect in law though not  necessarily in fact.          amendments to an indictment can of course be  direct rather than merely constructive, and they, too, are subject  to the same strict constitutional standards.                  see, e.g., united  states v. daraio, 445 f.3d 253, 260–61 & n.8 (3d cir. 2006)  (contrasting an alleged constructive amendment with a \"formal  amendment,\" and noting that there was no claim of \"actual amendment  of the indictment by a literal change of its terms\"); united states  v. ford, 872 f.2d 1231, 1235–36 (6th cir. 1989) (describing first  the separate categories of amendments and variances, and then  constructive amendments as a form of amendment); 1 charles alan  wright, et al., fed. prac. & proc. crim. § 128 (4th ed. 2008)  (\"allowing      the    case    against     the   accused     to    shift    in    this  [constructive] manner after the indictment is returned raises the  same concerns about undermining the grand jury's role as a direct  amendment.\").         here, the district court's amendment was anything  but   constructive,       as   it   literally    altered     the    words    of   the  indictment's text.         there may have been doubt as to whether the  change was permissible, but there can be no doubt that it was  actual.             in    any     event,     the   district   court    appears      to    have,  understandably, enlisted the nomenclature that we ourselves have  used.   the common meaning of constructive amendment in our cases,                                              -37- \f",
      "which can be traced back to united states v. dunn, 758 f.2d 30 (1st  cir. 1985), is \"'when the charging terms of the indictment are  altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court  after the grand jury has last passed upon them.'\"                     id. at 35  (quoting gaither v. united states, 413 f.2d 1061, 1071–72 (d.c.  cir. 1969)) (emphasis added).              the use of the word \"literally\"  suggests that the term encompasses changes that are factually true  just as much as those that are legally imputed.               yet the gaither  case quoted in dunn was not defining \"constructive amendment\" in  particular, but rather all amendments.              returning to the original  source yields perhaps a more sensible definition: amendments in  general   may   be    literal    or   in   effect    (and,   of    these,   it   is  specifically    the     latter    that     we   refer   to    as    constructive  amendments).    in any case, ever since dunn, we have adhered to our  definition of constructive amendments, most likely because they are  the amendments that we most often come across.               see 1 wright, et  al. § 128 (noting that \"direct attempts to amend an indictment in  any substantive way are rare\" and that \"[i]nstead, the most common  challenge in this area is a claim of 'constructive amendment'\").  on the rare occasion that we do confront a direct amendment to an  indictment, such as here, referring to it as constructive may  obfuscate the issue.       we will therefore eschew any reference to  \"constructive\" amendment here, where there was an express amending  of the indictment.                                          -38- \f",
      "              returning to our de novo review of the amendment, we  start with the basis for the rule against amending an indictment  without grand jury involvement.              the prohibition is based on the  presentment clause of the fifth amendment, which guarantees in  relevant part that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a  capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or  indictment of a grand jury.\"            u.s. const. amend. v.             the supreme  court   has    interpreted    this     provision      to   mean    that    \"after   an  indictment has been returned[,] its charges may not be broadened  through amendment except by the grand jury itself.\"                       stirone v.  united states, 361 u.s. 212, 215–16 (1960); accord russell v.  united states, 369 u.s. 749, 770 (1962) (holding that an indictment  may not be \"amended except by resubmission to the grand jury\"); ex  parte bain, 121 u.s. 1, 9–10 (1887).                nevertheless,     this    prohibition        does    not     extend   to  alterations that are \"merely a matter of form.\"                   russell, 369 u.s.  at 770; see also united states v. winter, 663 f.2d 1120, 1139–40  (1st cir. 1981); cf. united states v. eirby, 262 f.3d 31, 38 (1st  cir. 2001) (\"[a]n indictment is sufficient if it specifies the  elements of the offense charged, fairly apprises the defendant of  the charge against which he must defend, and allows him to contest  it without fear of double jeopardy.\").                     accordingly, we have  allowed ministerial corrections of clerical errors in names, dates,  and   citations,    so   long   as     the   change    would      not    deprive    the                                            -39- \f",
      "defendant of notice of the charges against him.                 see eirby, 262  f.3d at 38 (citations); united states v. rivera-ruiz, 244 f.3d 263,  271 (1st cir. 2001) (names); jervis v. hall, 622 f.2d 19, 22–23  (1st cir. 1980) (dates).          other circuits have similarly allowed  corrections regarding facts that are ancillary to the charged  offense.    see, e.g., united states v. powers, 572 f.2d 146, 152  (8th cir. 1978) (permitting change from \"30-30 caliber revolver\" to  \"30-30 caliber rifle\").          in short, when a change \"le[aves] the  substance of the charge unaffected, the switch d[oes] not usurp the  prerogative of the grand jury.\"           eirby, 262 f.3d at 38.              we agree with the district court that this is such a  case.   because dowdell was prosecuted under § 841(a)(1), which  prohibits distribution of any controlled substance regardless of  type, drug identity had no bearing on the substance of the charge.  see united states v. rutherford, 175 f.3d 899, 906 (11th cir. 1999)  (explaining that under § 841(a), \"[t]he nature of the controlled  substance    neither      constitutes    an    element   of   the   offense   nor  broadens    the   bases    for   conviction,     but   is   relevant   only   for  sentencing purposes\"); united states v. deisch, 20 f.3d 139, 151  (5th cir. 1994) (concluding that \"the identity of the involved  controlled substance as being 'cocaine base' rather than simply  'cocaine' is not an element of any section 841(a)(1) offense\").  the statute would thus hold dowdell as culpable for distribution of  cocaine base as it would for distribution of cocaine powder.                                            -40- \f",
      "indeed, the government could technically have omitted reference to  a particular controlled substance altogether. see united states v.  lewis, 113 f.3d 487, 493 (3d cir. 1997) (reasoning that because  \"identity of the substance is a sentencing factor rather than an  element   of   the   offense,\"   an   indictment   under   §   841(a)   could  theoretically avoid specifying the identity of the substance).14             had the government not clarified the matter before trial,  and instead proceeded under the original indictment, there would  have likely been no grounds for objection whatsoever.             certainly  there would have been no constructive amendment. see united states  v. fornilla-castillo, 408 f.3d 52, 66 (1st cir. 2005) (explaining  that no constructive amendment present where the difference between  the evidence presented and the text of the indictment does not  affect any element of the offense).          at worst, we might have found  a variance, although even that is far from certain.              see united  states v. wiley, 29 f.3d 345, 352 (8th cir. 1994) (doubting any  variance whatsoever would arise from difference between charge  involving \"cocaine\" and evidence involving cocaine base because  cocaine base is merely an isomer of cocaine); united states v.  deisch, 20 f.3d 139, 151 (5th cir. 1994) (holding that \"[f]or a  section 841(a)(1) offense involving cocaine base[,] the indictment        14       of course, a defendant might be entitled to notice at some point as to the nature of the substance alleged. we merely observe that under § 841(a), such notice needn't come by way of the indictment.                                         -41- \f",
      "need only allege, and the jury need only find, that the substance  was cocaine\").    and had we gone so far as to find a variance, it  would have been a harmless one, given all the notice that dowdell  had previously received that he was charged with distributing  cocaine base rather than cocaine powder.             cf. united states v.  twitty, 72 f.3d 228, 231 (1st cir. 1995) (\"so long as the statutory  violation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts  found are somewhat different than those charged -- so long as the  difference does not cause unfair prejudice.\"). it would be strange  indeed to punish the government for clarifying the indictment  before trial when it would have been permitted to proceed without  taking any action.              dowdell   argues   that    the   alteration   was   nevertheless  prohibited based on two premises that are not in fact implicated  here. first, he claims that the change to cocaine base effectively  exposed him to a harsher sentencing range.           yet even if sentencing  amplification were relevant, none occurred here.           it is true that  under § 841(a), cocaine base normally exposes defendants to steeper  sentencing ranges than does cocaine powder.           but here, dowdell was  sentenced as a career offender under section 4b1.1 of the u.s.  sentencing guidelines.     that provision would have applied in equal  force whether he were convicted of distributing cocaine powder or  cocaine base; the guideline range was a product of the 30-year  statutory   maximum   in   §   841(b)(1)(c)    and   dowdell's    particular                                          -42- \f",
      "criminal history category.            thus, because we conclude that the  change did not in fact alter the sentencing range, we need not  resolve     whether    sentencing    ramifications     are    relevant   to    the  amendment analysis.15                 second, dowdell asserts that the difference in chemical  composition between cocaine powder and cocaine base means that the  government would have had to proffer different evidence for each of  the    substances.       again,     even   assuming   the    relevance   of    the  conclusion, its predicate is incorrect.               as far as culpability  under § 841(a) is concerned, cocaine base is merely an isomer of  cocaine.       see wiley, 29 f.3d at 352; united states v. pierce, 893  f.2d    669,    676   (5th   cir.   1990).16    the   government   could      have         15         the district court expressly found no constitutional violation because \"mitigation of sentencing ramifications within the statutory maximum is not among the substantial rights protected by the right to be indicted by a grand jury.\" dowdell, 464 f. supp. 2d at 68. the \"substantial rights\" standard, however, is only appropriate in the context of variances. it is true that if the government had proceeded to trial with the original indictment, then variance doctrine would have been the appropriate analytical framework. but since we deal here with a direct amendment, rather than a variance, reference to the scope of the defendant's substantial rights is misplaced. in any case, we leave resolution of this issue for a day when the question is put more squarely before us.        16       we do not go so far as to hold in this case that a trial judge is necessarily permitted simply to swap any controlled substance under § 841(a) for any other controlled substance. \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" are inherently related in ways that other potential pairings are not. had the difference been between cocaine and vicodin, or cocaine and marijuana, it is possible the larger gap would weigh into our analysis. but cf. united states v. knuckles, 581 f.2d 305, 311–12 (2d cir. 1978) (finding no substantial variance between charge of heroin distribution under § 841(a) and evidence of cocaine distribution).                                         -43- \f",

      "affirmatively commit itself to the original 20-year statutory  maximum. rather, it offered a descriptive (and accurate) statement  of sentencing law.      the government explained to the court that the  proposed change to the indictment would not violate apprendi in  that the statutory maximum would remain the same irrespective of  the controlled substance alleged in the indictment.         see apprendi  v. new jersey, 530 u.s. 466 (2000).       at the time, that statutory  maximum was 20 years.        upon the filing of the information, it  became 30 years. although the number changed, the substance of the  government's remark -- that drug identity would have no impact on  the statutory maximum -- remained just as applicable.           thus we  disagree with dowdell's assertion that the government bound itself  to   any   particular    sentencing   recommendation   to   begin   with.  moreover, even had such a promise existed, there is no evidence in  the record to suggest that the court gave any weight whatsoever to  the government recommendation at sentencing. dowdell thus fails to  show a reasonable probability that he would have received a more  lenient sentence but for the alleged error.     see matos, 531 f.3d at  122–23.     for all of these reasons, we find no flaw in dowdell's  sentence.  iii. conclusion              the appellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.                                        -57- \f",

      "            per curiam.       the issue before us is whether the district  court     abused       its   discretion     by     denying     plaintiff    ginette  morrissette's post-trial motions for a new trial and for default  judgment    as     a    sanction   for    an     alleged   discovery     violation.  plaintiff was granted a continuance to conduct further discovery  when the disputed evidence emerged and expressly elected to proceed  with trial after doing so.           we find no abuse of discretion and  affirm.              the underlying case involves a federal products liability  action arising out of a forklift accident that occurred on june 9,  1999.     the forklift manufacturer is the defendant.                the forklift  driver died on june 17, 2006, while this litigation was pending;  the administrator of his estate proceeded to trial in the federal  district court of massachusetts.               trial began on january 15, 2008.  on the fourth day of a fifteen-day jury trial, plaintiff learned  that test results from a different model forklift had been used to  derive capacity information about the forklift involved in the  accident.        defendant     had   previously       denied    having     any   test  information relevant to the forklift model that the decedent had  been driving.              after hearing from both sides on the issue, the district  court denied plaintiff's motion for sanctions and opted to suspend  trial for three days to allow the parties \"to get to the bottom of  this testing and talk to whomever [they] need[ed] to talk to.\"                                             -2- \f",
      "during this period, plaintiff conducted three depositions and  obtained seventy-nine pages of documents related to the forklift  test results.      at a conference on january 31, 2008, the court asked  plaintiff's counsel how he intended to proceed.                plaintiff's  counsel repeatedly indicated his readiness to move forward with the  trial.    plaintiff did not ask for a further continuance or move for  a new trial and went forward with the trial.                plaintiff then  admitted the test results into evidence, had her liability expert  testify    about    them,   used   them    in   her   cross-examination   of  defendant's liability expert, and referred to them repeatedly at  closing.              on february 12, 2008, the jury returned a unanimous  verdict for the defendant.         plaintiff moved for a grant of new  trial under rules 59 and 60(b) and for entry of default judgment  against the defendant as a sanction for its alleged discovery  violation.     the trial judge died before acting on this motion.  another judge denied the motion on march 24, 2009, and denied  plaintiff's motion for reconsideration on may 13, 2009.1              on appeal, plaintiff urges that the district court erred  by refusing to set aside the jury's verdict.           we review for abuse  of discretion the denial of the new trial, jennings v. jones, 587        1           defendant's assertion that we lack jurisdiction over the march 24 order because plaintiff failed to file a notice of appeal within thirty days of that order is flatly contradicted by our caselaw. see marie v. allied home mortgage corp., 402 f.3d 1, 7 (1st cir. 2005).                                       -3- \f",

      "          lynch, chief judge.   ansys, inc. (\"ansys\") is a company  that produces propriety software in the field of computational  fluid dynamics (\"cfd\").     in august 2009, ansys sued its former  employee, dr. doru caraeni, and his new employer, computational  dynamics north america, ltd. (\"cdna\"), in the federal district  court for the district of new hampshire, alleging breach by dr.  caraeni of the noncompetition and confidentiality clauses in his  ansys employment contract, interference with contractual relations,  misappropriation of trade secrets, and unfair trade practices.  cdna and ansys are competitors; together they occupy approximately  80 percent of the market for cfd software, which is used for  modeling and simulating fluid and gas flows.    ansys had employed  dr. caraeni from january 2002 to may 2009 to develop code for cfd  simulation software.            ansys sought a preliminary injunction to enforce the  provisions of a one-year noncompetition clause in dr. caraeni's  employment agreement.     the district court denied the request,  finding that ansys had not met the requirements for injunctive  relief.   see ansys, inc. v. computational dynamics n. am., ltd.,  civ. no. 09-cv-284-sm, 2009 wl 4403745 (d.n.h. nov. 25, 2009).   we  expedited the appeal.     after oral argument this court issued an  order affirming the denial of preliminary injunctive relief.     we  also said we would later issue our opinion in this case, as we do  now, and judgment would not enter until we had done so.                                   -2- \f",
      "                                      i.              our standard of review for denials of injunctive relief  is strict: \"we will reverse such a denial only if the district  court mistook the law, clearly erred in its factual assessments, or  otherwise   abused     its   discretion     in    granting     the     preliminary  injunction.\"       mcclure v. galvin, 386 f.3d 36, 41 (1st cir. 2004)  (internal quotation marks omitted).              while we think this case is  close, we cannot say the court abused its discretion.              when     deciding   whether     to     grant     ansys     preliminary  injunctive relief, the district court was required to weigh four  factors: (1) whether ansys had shown a likelihood of success on the  merits,   (2)      whether   ansys   had    shown    that     it     would   suffer  irreparable harm if the injunction was denied, (3) the balance of  the relevant hardships, and (4) any impact that the court's ruling  may have on the public interest.            see wine & spirits retailers,  inc. v. rhode island, 418 f.3d 36, 46 (1st cir. 2005).                  the first  factor, likelihood of success, is usually given particularly heavy  weight. waldron v. george weston bakeries inc., 570 f.3d 5, 8 (1st  cir. 2009).        the district court denied ansys's motion on the  grounds that the company had failed to demonstrate likely success  on the merits and also failed to show that it would                          suffer  irreparable harm absent injunctive relief.                 ansys, inc., 2009 wl  4403745, at *5-7.                                           -3- \f",
      "           we begin our review of the district court's decision with  the contract clause in question, which dr. caraeni had signed in  september 2001.    it reads, in relevant part, \"i agree that for a  period of one (1) year following termination of my employment with  [ansys], i will not become an employee . . . or in any way engage  in or contribute my knowledge to a competitor of [ansys].\"             perhaps recognizing how poorly drafted this clause is,  ansys offers two pertinent narrowing constructions: (1) the clause  only applies to those employees who have access to confidential  information or trade secrets--thus, the clause would not apply to,  for instance, a maintenance worker; and (2) the clause only applies  to employees who are in a position to use that information at their  new employer.     this interpretation, of course, requires judicial  reconstruction of the broadly drafted contract language.             against the backdrop of these constructions, ansys argues  it has to show two things, and no more, to establish breach of  contract: that dr. caraeni had access to confidential information  while at ansys and that he is in a position to use this knowledge  at cdna.   ansys asserts it met this burden on the evidence produced  at the one-day evidentiary hearing before the district court.             as a result, ansys argues, it has shown dr. caraeni was  in breach of his contract and that it will succeed on the merits of  its claims.     since likelihood of success on the merits normally  weighs heavily in the preliminary injunction calculus, ansys urges                                    -4- \f",
      "this showing is sufficient to merit preliminary injunctive relief.  ansys also argues that proving breach, and no more, was sufficient  to demonstrate irreparable harm and further support its request for  the preliminary injunction.              ansys asserts that holding it to any greater showing on  the likelihood of success or irreparable harm would effectively  eliminate the noncompete clause from the contract. ansys says that  for the noncompete clause to have any meaning, the clause must be  read to give ansys some greater benefit than the protection it  enjoys under common law for its trade secrets and confidential  information.     ansys   urges   that   the   district   court   erred   by  analyzing this case as though it was simply a trade secrets case.  after all, ansys notes, it did not seek a preliminary injunction on  its trade secrets claim.              ansys's argument about the import of its contract clause  is not irrational and one might well be sympathetic to it.               see  cont'l group, inc. v. kinsley, 422 f. supp. 838, 843 (d. conn.  1976) (finding a covenant not to compete for eighteen months  reasonable under new york law to the extent that it barred similar  employment at a direct competitor working to develop an identical  product).    as judge newman observed in that case, it is unclear  that the test for enforcing a noncompetition covenant should be the  same as would be used in obtaining an injunction to bar disclosure  of trade secrets or an injunction to enforce a covenant not to                                     -5- \f",
      "disclose         trade     secrets.          the   court   explained,      \"[t]he  non-competition covenant adds something to the protection available  to the employer beyond what he would expect from the normal  incidents of the employer-employee relationship or from a secrecy  agreement.\"            id. at 844.        here, the contract clause could be  justified as a prophylaxis, protecting ansys in a situation that  created a high risk of disclosure of its confidential information  to a competitor.          see id. at 845.                   whether new hampshire law would enforce an agreement so  construed is quite a different matter.              ansys's arguments presume  its noncompetition clause is enforceable. however, new hampshire's  public policy discourages covenants not to compete, allowing them  only       \"if   the    restraint    is    reasonable,   given   the   particular  circumstances of the case.\"           merrimack valley wood prods., inc. v.  near, 876 a.2d 757, 762 (n.h. 2005).               no new hampshire cases are  directly on point, as the vast majority of noncompetition agreement  cases considered by the state's supreme court have turned on other  issues, such as the protection of employers' interest in customer  good will. see, e.g., concord orthopaedics prof'l ass'n v. forbes,  702 a.2d 1273, 1276 (n.h. 1997); technical aid corp. v. allen, 591  a.2d 262, 266-67 (n.h. 1991).1          1           both parties note a single case in which the new hampshire supreme court addressed a superficially similar attempt by an employer to enforce a covenant not to compete to prevent an employee from working for a competitor in a narrow field, upholding a district court's determination that the noncompetition agreement                                              -6- \f",
      "           new hampshire courts have, however, articulated general  criteria by which we may assess ansys's claims:             to determine whether a restrictive covenant            ancillary to an employment contract is reasonable,            we engage in a three-part inquiry: first, whether            the restriction is greater than necessary to            protect the legitimate interests of the employer;            second, whether the restriction imposes an undue            hardship upon the employee; and third, whether the            restriction is injurious to the public interest.  acas acquisitions (precitech) inc. v. hobert, 923 a.2d 1076, 1084  (n.h. 2007).      a covenant that fails any one of these criteria \"is  unreasonable and unenforceable.\"          merrimack valley wood prods.,  inc., 876 a.2d at 762; see also id. at 763-64 (affirming that an  agreement that broadly barred an employee from working with any  client who had transacted business with his employer in the past  year was unenforceable, reasoning that it went \"far beyond the  defendant's sphere of customer goodwill, and was more restrictive  than necessary to protect the plaintiffs' legitimate interests\").  new   hampshire    courts   have   further   clarified   that   employers'    at issue was enforceable. see acas acquisitions (precitech) inc. v. hobert, 923 a.2d 1076, 1089 (n.h. 2007). however, acas relied on a variety of facts not presented by this case. id. at 1087-89.      moreover, to the limited extent that ansys relies on acas, it mischaracterizes the court's holding. the court did not, as ansys suggests, \"presume[] irreparable harm from the presumed use of . . . information.\"    instead, it cited specific evidence \"that the defendant intended to use his knowledge learned at [plaintiff's company] to help\" his new employer, id. at 1083, 1085 (internal quotation marks omitted), and affirmed the district court's holding that the defendant's \"use and disclosure of . . . information to or for the benefit of [his new employer] has caused, and will continue to cause,\" the plaintiff harm, id. 1087.                                      -7- \f",
      "\"legitimate   interests\"   include   \"trade   secrets   that   have   been  communicated to the employee during the course of employment\" and  \"confidential information communicated by the employer to the  employee, but not involving trade secrets.\" syncom indus., inc. v.  wood, 920 a.2d 1178, 1185 (n.h. 2007).            whether ansys's construction of the noncompete clause was  reasonable–-that is, whether it went no further than was necessary  to protect its legitimate interests, imposed no undue hardship on  dr. caraeni, and was not inconsistent with the public interest--all  involve policy choices that have not been explicitly decided in  this context by the new hampshire courts or legislature.          absent  such guidance, we cannot say ansys has clearly demonstrated its  likelihood of success on the breach of contract claim, nor can we  conclude that the district court abused its discretion by finding  that ansys had failed to make this showing.            we also cannot say that the district court abused its  discretion when it found ansys had not shown the likelihood of  irreparable injury.   ansys's claim that its showing of breach was  sufficient to show irreparable harm again assumes that the covenant  not to compete is enforceable.       in any event, we reject ansys's  suggestion at oral argument that because of the difficulty of  proving damages from breach of the covenant, as opposed to damages  from the actual use of confidential material, we should deem its  remedy at law inadequate. we further reject its related claim that                                    -8- \f",
      "this alleged inadequacy would justify equitable relief for breach  of the covenant without any showing of injury.              new hampshire law  has not adopted that approach.                as to the district court's analysis of ansys's injury, we  will accept arguendo that dr. caraeni had access to confidential  proprietary information.       the district court concluded that even  were that so, \"ansys has failed to demonstrate that [dr. caraeni]  is likely to use that [confidential] information during the course  of his employment at cdna.\"        this conclusion was based on factual  findings, which we cannot set aside unless they constituted clear  error.      e.g., mcclure, 386 f.3d at 41.                the district court explained that it found credible the  testimony of dr. wayne smith, who is the general manager of cdna.  in particular, the court accepted three aspects of dr. smith's  testimony: (1) \"that cdna maintains and enforces a strict policy  preventing its employees from using confidential and trade secret  information they may have acquired from prior employers;\" (2) that  dr. caraeni had not been assigned and, in the near term (that is,  to the may 2010 date for expiration of the one-year period since  his departure from ansys), will not be assigned \"to perform any  work   at    cdna   that   might   allow   him   to   use    any   of   ansys's  confidential or trade secret information;\" and (3) that any trade  secret or confidential information dr. caraeni had acquired at  ansys would not be useful to work on cdna's cfd software because of                                        -9- \f",
      "the   different    architecture     of    the   two   companies'    respective  software codes.      ansys, inc., 2009 wl 4403745, at *6.             ansys emphatically attacks the third of these findings in  particular and urges that it constitutes clear error.2                 even if  there were reason to be skeptical of the third finding--after all,  cdna chose to hire dr. caraeni for reasons that may have included  what he learned in his prior employment--that would not make the  finding clear error. more pertinently, the district court reasoned  dr.   caraeni   would   not     perform   any   tasks   that   might   require  confidential information he had obtained at ansys.                 the court's  first two factual findings support its conclusion, and we cannot  say that they were clearly erroneous.             there is no need to discuss the myriad other arguments  the parties have pressed.                                       ii.             the district court's denial of the preliminary injunction  is affirmed.      so ordered.           2           ansys also argues that the district court erred in crediting dr. smith's testimony, urging that his statements were self-serving and speculative. given our traditional deference to district court credibility determinations, e.g., jennings v. jones, 587 f.3d 430, 444 (1st cir. 2009), we cannot say the court's decision was an abuse of discretion.                                       -10- \f",
